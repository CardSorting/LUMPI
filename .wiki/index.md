# Workspace Knowledge Ledger

This ledger now routes to the current LUMI workspace operating docs and preserves older forensic pages as historical context. Prefer the root continuity docs for current agent operation.

## 🗺️ Navigation

- [**Agent Playbook**](../AGENT_PLAYBOOK.md) — Current-state operating brief for future agents.
- [**Recoverable Context Compaction**](recoverable-context-compaction.md) —
  Why context is projected, how BroccoliDB CAS/SQLite central recovery works,
  tier/cursor limits, silent rollover, failure semantics, and validation.
- [**Agent Fast Orientation**](agent/playbook.md) — Current execution hot paths and validation loop.
- [**Agent Memory**](agent/agent-memory.md) — Durable constraints and safety boundaries.
- [**Key Findings**](agent/key-findings.md) — Evidence-backed execution and throughput findings.
- [**Troubleshooting**](agent/troubleshooting.md) — Reproduced failures and exact recovery commands.
- [**Common Pitfalls**](agent/common-pitfalls.md) — Workspace-specific execution traps.
- [**Patterns**](agent/patterns.md) — Repeatable fast-path implementation patterns.
- [**Workspace Wiki**](../WIKI.md) — Stable architecture, subsystem map, setup, testing, deployment notes.
- [**Troubleshooting**](../TROUBLESHOOTING.md) — Reproduced failures, fixes, confirmed non-causes, validation guidance.

- [**MEOW Philosophy**](meow-philosophy.md) — Normative reasoning and operating principles.
- [**MEOW Technical Whitepaper**](meow-whitepaper.md) — Canonical technical architecture reference.
- [**MEOW Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**](adr/README.md) — Decision records for the execution model.
- [**MEOW-011: Approval Is Execution Admission**](adr/MEOW-011-execution-approval-admission.md) — Central approval, causal permit, and handler-intent contract.
- [**MEOW-012: Transactional Task Lifecycle Authority**](adr/MEOW-012-transactional-task-lifecycle.md) — Generation-bound state transitions, cancellation, resume, parent/child propagation, and immutable events.
- [**MEOW-013: Recoverable Turn-Boundary Context Projection**](adr/MEOW-013-recoverable-context-projection.md) — Durable-source, bounded, stream-safe context projection.
- [**MEOW-014: Universal Zenith Resilience Engineering & Epistemic Graph Infrastructure**](adr/MEOW-014-universal-zenith-resilience.md) — Circuit breakers, speculative read caching, adaptive lock backoff jitter, Epistemic PageRank confidence scoring, 4-pillar forensic diagnostic probes, and Task DAG dependency scheduling.
- [**MEOW Migration Report**](meow-migration.md) — Before/after evolution and measured evidence.
- [**00 Forensic Substrate Report**](00-forensics.md) — Historical forensic report; refresh before treating as current.

## Current Source Priority

1. Implementation and package manifests.
2. Root continuity docs listed above.
3. Maintained docs under `docs/` and `broccolidb/docs/`.
4. Historical `.wiki` forensic pages after they are revalidated.
