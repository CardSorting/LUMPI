# MEOW: Model-Efficient Order-aware Workflow

## Executive Brief

**Status:** Canonical architecture reference  
**Audience:** Maintainers, reviewers, contributors, and project leads  
**Scope:** Task execution, dependency scheduling, structured concurrency, presentation, completion, caching, auditing, and lifecycle management within `src/core/task/`.

### What is MEOW?

**MEOW decides what can safely run at the same time and what must wait, then makes sure the final result still looks like everything happened in order.**

MEOW is the **execution coordinator** for a model turn: it decides **when work starts, what can overlap, what must wait, and how the completed work is presented consistently.**

At any moment, MEOW is continuously answering five core questions:
1. **Can this run now?** (Does it need user approval or credentials first?)
2. **Does it conflict with anything?** (Can these queries run together, or does a mutation fence require serialization?)
3. **Do I already know the answer?** (Can we reuse cached path authority or coalesced request results?)
4. **How do I keep the final output deterministic?** (How do we project out-of-order executions back into model-emission sequence?)
5. **Can I stop immediately if the task dies?** (Does task cancellation kill active processes and release resources immediately?)

## What MEOW Is Responsible For

MEOW is responsible for coordinating execution during a model turn. Specifically, it determines:
* **which operations are eligible to begin** (scheduling readiness);
* **which operations must wait** (prerequisite enforcement);
* **which operations may execute concurrently** (concurrency allocation);
* **how concurrent execution is isolated** (invocation-local context capturing);
* **how execution is cancelled** (cancellation propagation);
* **how results are projected deterministically** (canonical sequence reconstruction);
* **when execution is considered authoritatively complete** (completion gate evaluation).

MEOW is **not** responsible for tool semantics, permission policy, or presentation rendering. Those remain responsibilities of the tool handlers, policy layer, and UI respectively.

## Executive Summary

The execution engine was historically optimized for correctness through conservative serialization. Although safe, this design allowed presentation, governance, and bookkeeping concerns to occupy portions of the critical path without materially improving correctness. Independent sibling tools waited behind one another, shared presentation state acted as an accidental execution lock, and advisory persistence could delay results whose validity had already been established.

This work replaces that model with the MEOW execution architecture.

Throughput is the outcome; dependencies, resource ownership, and authoritative completion are the governing principles. Eligible sibling operations can execute concurrently under a bounded, task-owned scheduler. Conflicting, prerequisite-bound, interactive, and conservatively classified operations remain ordered. Batch results are projected deterministically. The critical path is narrower than before, although completion still contains synchronous audit evaluation, optional workspace-artifact persistence, UI persistence, and checkpoint work.

This is not merely a local performance optimization. For model turns that expose an eligible sibling batch, it changes admission from presenter-driven sequencing to dependency-constrained scheduling governed by MEOW.

## Problem Statement

The previous execution path treated a model response as a sequential series of tool invocations:

```text
model response
    -> presentation ownership
    -> execute one tool
    -> update shared state
    -> admit the next tool
    -> repeat
```

Presentation controlled execution, execution controlled admission, and shared UI state became an implicit scheduler. Operations with no dependency or resource conflict were serialized because they shared presentation machinery rather than because correctness required ordering.

Completion had similar coupling. Diagnostics, audit persistence, roadmap bookkeeping, and other advisory work could remain on the response path even after the requested work had been validated successfully.

The MEOW architecture separates these four distinct concerns and gives each one an explicit contract:

* execution eligibility
* safety and governance
* visual presentation
* durable observability

## Architectural Transformation

A contiguous group of complete tool blocks is interpreted as a dependency-constrained batch under MEOW when parallel tool calling is enabled and the group contains more than one tool.

The visual transition from sequential sequencing to MEOW's parallel batching is shown below:

    end
```

### Batch Slicing & Sequencing Rules

Within a parallel tool-calling session, contiguous blocks are analyzed and sliced based on the following protocol:

1. **Eligibility Filter:**
   - **Contiguity:** Only tool blocks emitted in a single model turn and parsed within the same assistant message stream window are grouped.
   - **Multiplicity:** The group must contain more than one tool block ($> 1$). Single tool invocations bypass the batch path.
   - **System Controls:** The global `parallelToolCalling` flag must be set to `true`.
2. **Lane Partitioning:**
   - **Concurrent Lane:** Query tools (e.g., `read_file`, `list_files`, `search_files`, `list_code_definition_names`) that do not lock mutating resources are scheduled in parallel.
   - **Serialized Lane:** Interactive tools, workspace mutations, and unknown tools are locked under a workspace-wide fence (`workspace-mutation` write claim) and executed sequentially.
   - **Prerequisites:** Tool calls referencing the output index of another tool (e.g., `[depends_on:X]`) are scheduled to execute only after their upstream sibling successfully completes.

Within that batch, execution eligibility is determined by model-emission dependencies, conservative resource claims, checkpoint readiness, and safety boundaries. Outside the batch path, the existing single-tool presentation flow remains in service.

For workspace-local query siblings, presentation is captured per invocation and replayed after execution in canonical order. Interactive and non-query tools retain shared presentation constraints and are conservatively ordered.

## Architectural Principles

### 1. Model-Efficient Execution

Eligible independent siblings should begin independently.

Ordering is introduced only when required by:

* an explicit prerequisite
* a tool-result reference
* a shared resource
* a mutation conflict
* an approval boundary
* a completion barrier
* another correctness-bearing constraint

Model-emission order determines canonical presentation, not execution eligibility.

### 2. Resource-Oriented Coordination

Coordination is scoped to the resource being protected.

Relevant resources include:

* normalized filesystem targets
* diff-buffer ownership
* terminal process ownership
* shared environment state
* approval channels
* checkpoint-sensitive mutations
* workspace-wide mutation scope

The current classifier permits read/read independence and permits queries to overlap a mutation when their claims do not conflict. It deliberately serializes every classified mutation against every other classified mutation through the `workspace-mutation` claim, even when file targets differ.

### 3. Risk-Proportional Governance

Governance exists to contain concrete material risk, not to serve as a general-purpose scheduler.

Synchronous blocking is reserved for work that is:

* destructive
* protected
* externally visible
* approval-bound
* credential-sensitive
* mutually conflicting
* checkpoint-dependent
* directly invalid

Advisory uncertainty should produce evidence, diagnostics, or bounded fallback behavior—not automatic execution paralysis.

### 4. Authoritative Completion

Completion is the single point at which required work has been validated and determined correct.

Completion is not redefined by the settlement of every supporting subsystem.

The following are currently scheduled after result presentation where implemented:

* audit persistence
* roadmap journaling
* completion-audit persistence
* roadmap finalization

Completion audit evaluation is still performed before the authoritative decision, and optional audit workspace artifacts are persisted synchronously when enabled. Completion-message persistence and checkpoint saving also remain awaited after presentation. These are residual critical-path mechanisms, not claims of fully asynchronous completion.

### 5. Deterministic Projection

Execution order and presentation order are intentionally separate.

Eligible sibling operations may start and finish out of order. The batch executor returns envelopes in model-emission sequence, replays captured query presentation in that order, and appends tool-result content in that order.

This preserves responsiveness without making the user experience nondeterministic.

### 6. Structured Concurrency

Every child admitted through `SiblingToolScheduler` is:

* owned by its parent task
* bounded by scheduler capacity
* cancellable through task lifecycle
* attributable to one invocation
* joined before finalization
* represented by an isolated result envelope

Task abort cancels the active scheduler, and task abort handling waits for the active batch promise. The scheduler itself waits for every `run` promise to settle; prompt interruption inside a tool still depends on that tool honoring the supplied `AbortSignal`.

## Implementation Mechanisms

The MEOW architecture is implemented through the following components.

### `TaskLatencyTracker.ts`

Records bounded, monotonic lifecycle evidence from task admission through deferred persistence.

Instrumentation is advisory and fail-open. It must never become a receipt requirement, execution gate, or synchronous persistence dependency.

### `SiblingToolDependency.ts`

Classifies sibling operations and produces:

* canonical resource claims
* conflict edges
* prerequisite edges
* explicit result-reference edges
* completion barriers
* workspace-wide fences for unknown mutations

The classifier makes previously implicit ordering rules explicit and testable.

### `SiblingToolScheduler.ts`

Provides bounded, task-owned execution with:

* constructor-configurable fan-out; the task path currently passes the default capacity of four
* dependency-aware admission
* cancellation propagation
* deterministic joining
* queue and execution evidence
* dependency-local failure handling
* partial-success preservation

The scheduler does not manufacture concurrency. It permits concurrency where the conservative dependency model finds no earlier edge and capacity is available.

### `ToolInvocationContext.ts`

Provides invocation-local evidence and presentation capture.

The batch path uses invocation-local result storage for all children and captures presentation events for workspace-local queries. Non-query and approval-sensitive children continue to use shared presentation surfaces and corresponding conflict claims.

### `ToolExecutor.ts`

Produces isolated tool outcomes and advances cache generations after qualifying mutations.

Execution evidence remains associated with the invocation that produced it, regardless of completion order.

### `IoRequestCoalescer.ts`

Defines cache and request-coalescing identity through:

* canonical target
* cache generation
* operation type
* result-affecting inputs

Qualifying local mutations replace the task's coalescer with a new task-wide generation. An older in-flight operation may finish for its original caller and populate its old coalescer object, but cannot populate the replacement generation.

### `AttemptCompletionHandler.ts`

Evaluates the canonical completion lifecycle and action guard once per completion attempt, then runs advisory completion diagnostics and audit evaluation before latching the authoritative result.

It is the correctness-bearing completion boundary.

### `completionAudit.ts` and Task Pending-Persistence State

Schedule pending completion-audit persistence after result presentation and roadmap finalization after completion handling reaches its finalization branch.

Those two scheduled operations are off the response path. Optional audit workspace-artifact persistence, completion-message persistence, and checkpoint saving remain synchronous today.

## Measured Evidence

Deterministic scheduler workloads demonstrate lower wall-clock latency for independent operations while preserving required serialization.

| Workload | Sequential estimate | Concurrent wall time | Observed behavior |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Four independent reads | 280 ms | 100 ms | Four-way concurrency |
| Two reads and two searches | 290 ms | 100 ms | Four-way concurrency |
| Diagnostic and read-only command | 220 ms | 140 ms | Independent execution lanes overlap |
| Mutation and two disjoint reads | 230 ms | 120 ms | Governed mutation overlaps non-conflicting reads |
| Overlapping mutations | 200 ms | 200 ms | Intentionally serialized |
| One failed sibling and two successes | 190 ms | 100 ms | Successful independent results preserved |

These fixtures validate scheduler behavior and latency accounting. They are deterministic test measurements, not live provider or extension-host benchmarks.

`TaskLatencyTracker.test.ts` verifies the lifecycle evidence surface across:

* task admission
* first model token
* tool recognition
* first visible progress
* dispatch
* first useful I/O
* completion decision
* result projection
* deferred persistence

Task latency snapshots are the implementation's host/provider observation surface; this documentation contains no recorded live-provider benchmark.

Evidence is separated by provenance:

* **Current grounding pass (2026-07-12):** 44 focused dependency, scheduler, batch, cache, latency, and completion-audit tests passed; documentation links and diff whitespace passed.
* **Recorded implementation-pass evidence:** 2,263 passing unit tests, 4 expected pending tests, 5 passing targeted presentation-failure regressions, plus successful TypeScript, lint, and roadmap-audit runs.
* **Not measured:** live model-provider latency, webview latency, real filesystem/subprocess speedup, and production false-blocker frequency.

## Preserved Safety Guarantees

The affected paths continue to invoke the existing correctness-bearing boundaries, including:

* `.dietcodeignore`
* workspace-boundary enforcement
* external-path controls
* protected resources
* credential restrictions
* destructive and manual approvals
* first-mutation checkpoint readiness
* mutation conflict detection
* cancellation
* rollback
* receipt integrity
* external publication controls
* direct validation failures

The sibling classifier does not bypass these checks; each admitted child still executes through `ToolExecutor` and its normal local validation path.

The system is faster because coordination is more precise, not because protection has been removed.

## Intentional Serialization

The following remain serialized because they protect concrete shared resources or protocol decisions:

* shared foreground terminal-process ownership
* interactive approval through a single response channel
* commands that mutate shared environment state
* all sibling mutations under the current task-wide `workspace-mutation` claim, which also avoids concurrent use of shared mutation/presentation machinery
* completion barriers
* unresolved prerequisites and tool-result references

These are architectural constraints, not presentation ceremony.

Future concurrency should be introduced only when a narrower ownership boundary, isolated invocation state, or reversible commit protocol proves that the existing serialization is broader than necessary.

## Remaining Work Register (Verified Limitations)

The following verified limitations remain in the MEOW/ACC subsystem:

### 1. Process Spawning for Distinct Searches
* **Current Measured Impact:** Spawning 4 distinct searches incurs a 39.7 ms to 56.3 ms wall-clock cost in deterministic fixtures.
* **Reason it Remains:** Each unique `rg` (Ripgrep) query requires spawning a new independent OS process.
* **Safety or Architectural Constraint:** Process isolation is the simplest and safest way to execute Ripgrep without implementing a persistent, stateful in-process search engine.
* **Evidence Required to Reopen:** Measured proof that process spawning is the dominant bottleneck in a realistic multi-turn workflow, and that a persistent worker pool or multiplexed search protocol preserves OS-level safety, file exclusion, and resource budgets.
* **Suggested Priority:** Low.

### 2. Cold Authority Resolution Costs
* **Current Measured Impact:** Cold authority resolution takes 1.349 ms, which is ~55% of the ready-to-backend-start latency (2.426 ms).
* **Reason it Remains:** Establishing path canonicalization, workspace containment, ancestor matching, and ignore policies requires initial synchronous filesystem calls (stats, realpaths) for cold paths.
* **Safety or Architectural Constraint:** We must verify containment and policy before any read/write to prevent directory traversal and symlink escape vulnerabilities.
* **Evidence Required to Reopen:** Verified implementation of asynchronous, non-blocking authority prewarming that does not block scheduling or weaken containment invariants.
* **Suggested Priority:** Medium.

### 3. Initial Ignore Evidence for Recursive Listing
* **Current Measured Impact:** Bounded BFS listing takes 11.1 ms (Cold) to emit the first page.
* **Reason it Remains:** The glob list service must parse and load ignore files (e.g., `.dietcodeignore`, `.gitignore`) from the workspace root before any file names can be filtered and exposed.
* **Safety or Architectural Constraint:** Exposing file structures before ignore policies are loaded could leak private or ignored directories.
* **Evidence Required to Reopen:** Proof that ignore-rule parsing can be safely cached across workspace changes or pre-parsed in the background without stale data risk.
* **Suggested Priority:** Medium.

### 4. Buffered/Weakly Cancellable Document Libraries
* **Current Measured Impact:** Large binary parsing (e.g., DOCX, Excel, PDF libraries) buffers full structures in memory and ignores cooperative abort signals mid-execution.
* **Reason it Remains:** External parser libraries do not export or honor `AbortSignal` hooks internally.
* **Safety or Architectural Constraint:** Modifying external dependencies directly is unsafe and increases maintenance overhead.
* **Evidence Required to Reopen:** Availability of lightweight, natively stream-based, and cancellable parsing libraries for target document types.
* **Suggested Priority:** Low.

### 5. Shared Diff State Mutation Locking
* **Current Measured Impact:** Concurrent mutations on disjoint files remain serialized (200 ms for overlapping mutations) because of a task-wide `workspace-mutation` claim.
* **Reason it Remains:** All mutations share a single diff-buffer state in the editor and execution layers.
* **Safety or Architectural Constraint:** Parallel mutations on the same diff-buffer would cause race conditions and merge conflicts.
* **Evidence Required to Reopen:** Implementation of multi-buffer diff isolation and transaction-level staging area before commit.
* **Suggested Priority:** Low.

### 6. Stream-Separated Sibling Batches
* **Current Measured Impact:** Sibling tools separated by stream boundaries execute sequentially instead of coalescing/batching.
* **Reason it Remains:** The scheduler can only batch tools that are parsed within the same parser window.
* **Safety or Architectural Constraint:** The runtime cannot speculate on future incoming stream chunks without delaying currently admitted tools.
* **Evidence Required to Reopen:** A streaming parser heuristic that reliably groups siblings without introducing user-visible execution delay.
* **Suggested Priority:** Low.

## Evolution Rule

Future optimization work must follow an evidence-driven sequence:

1. Measure the actual critical path.
2. Identify the exact source of contention.
3. Determine whether serialization protects correctness or merely reflects shared implementation state.
4. Narrow coordination to the smallest valid resource boundary.
5. Preserve task ownership and authoritative completion.
6. Verify the change with deterministic correctness and latency evidence.

Do not introduce a new global coordinator, lifecycle gate, synchronization layer, or mandatory receipt without demonstrating a concrete correctness requirement that cannot be enforced more narrowly.

The architecture should evolve through increasingly precise ownership—not increasingly elaborate ceremony.

> **Architectural thesis:** Execution should be constrained by dependencies, resource ownership, and concrete risk—not by presentation order, procedural ceremony, or advisory infrastructure.
