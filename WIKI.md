## System Summary

LUMI is a human-in-the-loop VS Code extension for agentic pair programming. The monorepo has two main packages:

| Layer | Paths | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| LUMI session layer | `src/`, `webview-ui/`, `proto/` | VS Code extension activation, webview UI, task loop, tools, providers, MCP, hooks, completion gates |
| BroccoliDB substrate | `broccolidb/` | Local cognitive memory, runtime graph, Spider/repair substrate, durable snapshots |

Do not merge these narratives. LUMI owns IDE session behavior and approvals. BroccoliDB owns substrate truth and runtime graph capabilities.

## Architecture Map

| Subsystem | Primary paths | Stable owner / boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Extension activation | `src/extension.ts` | Registers VS Code commands, webview, roadmap watcher, migrations |
| Host abstraction | `src/hosts/host-provider.ts`, `src/hosts/vscode/` | Core code should use host abstractions instead of direct `vscode` imports |
| Controller | `src/core/controller/` | Task lifecycle, webview RPC, MCP hub, auth, state |
| Agent loop | `src/core/task/` | Prompt -> API stream -> parse message -> execute tools -> completion |
| Tools | `src/core/task/tools/`, `src/shared/tools.ts` | 63 typed default tools plus dynamic subagent tools |
| Completion/finalization | `src/core/task/tools/completion/`, `src/core/task/tools/finalization/` | Deterministic lifecycle decisions, action guards, receipts, wiki finalization |
| Coordination authority | `src/core/governance/`, `src/core/swarm/SwarmMutexService.ts`, `src/infrastructure/db/Config.ts` | SQLite production leases, fencing, projections, reconciliation, durable terminal results |
| Workspace intelligence | `src/core/workspace-intelligence/` | Finalization-time cognitive model, drift findings, classified knowledge signals |
| Providers | `src/core/api/`, `src/shared/providers/providers.json` | Five active provider keys in current code/UI |
| Prompts | `src/core/prompts/system-prompt/` | Variant-specific system prompts and tool descriptions |
| Context/rules/skills | `src/core/context/`, `.dietcoderules/`, `.agents/skills/` | User/project instructions and optional skills |
| Context window projection | `src/core/context/context-management/`, `src/core/context/ContextPruner.ts`, `src/core/task/index.ts` | Durable-source, turn-boundary, progressively bounded context compaction; see [Recoverable Context Compaction](.wiki/recoverable-context-compaction.md) |
| Master of Design (MoD) | `src/core/prompts/system-prompt/components/mod_designer_steering.ts` | Unified System Prompt Steering Toggle. Runs through standard coding task loop with 100% tool parity (`read_file`, `replace_in_file`, `execute_command`, `browser_action`, subagents, MCP tools), automatically steered as a Principal Frontend Architect & Design System Linter (restrained neutrals, hairline borders, monospaced tags, custom bezier curves, anti-AI-slop matrices). |
| Storage & Cache Manager | `src/services/storage/StorageManager.ts` | Multi-tiered storage engine, shadow Git vacuuming (`git gc --prune=now`), dynamic exclusions, and background maintenance |
| Webview UI | `webview-ui/` | React/Vite sidebar, settings, message rendering |
| Protocol | `proto/`, `src/generated/` | Protobuf/gRPC contracts; generated outputs should not be hand-edited |
| Roadmap/governance | `src/services/roadmap/`, `ROADMAP.md` | Steering, gates, roadmap lifecycle |
| BroccoliDB Substrate (Passes 1-12) | `broccolidb/core/policy/spider/` | 16MB contiguous `ArenaAllocator` slab, lock-free `SharedArrayBuffer` Atomics `FastIPC`, `TaskScheduler` work-stealing deques, `ZenIOEngine` zero-copy kernel streaming, $O(1)$ lazy snapshot indexing, single-pass Welford online variance, fast string slicing, and monomorphic V8 shapes (`FindingEntry`, `SymbolProviderEntry`, `TypeMirrorDiagnosticEntry`). |

## Core Data Flow

```text
VS Code activation
  -> HostProvider initialization
  -> VscodeWebviewProvider
  -> Controller
  -> Task
  -> buildApiHandler(mode)
  -> LLM stream
  -> assistant message parser
  -> ToolExecutorCoordinator
  -> tool handlers / HostProvider / MCP / BroccoliDB
  -> completion lifecycle decision engine
  -> run_finalization / receipt seal
  -> WorkspaceIntelligenceEngine
  -> .wiki/intelligence + optional BroccoliDB cognitive memory
```

## Completion And Finalization Contract

The completion spine is central to recent architecture:

```text
snapshot builder -> decision engine -> action contract -> action guard
```

Key files:

- `src/core/task/tools/completion/completionSnapshotBuilder.ts`
- `src/core/task/tools/completion/CompletionLifecycleDecisionEngine.ts`
- `src/core/task/tools/completion/CompletionActionGuard.ts`
- `src/core/task/tools/handlers/AttemptCompletionHandler.ts`
- `src/core/task/tools/handlers/RunFinalizationToolHandler.ts`
- `src/core/task/tools/finalization/AutonomousDocumentationFinalizer.ts`

Rule: handlers adapt and execute; the decision engine decides; the action guard enforces. Do not add new completion eligibility logic in a handler. A successful decision becomes terminal only after `AttemptCompletionHandler` commits the lease/state CAS row in `task_completions`.

## Coordination And Storage Contract

- Production uses immutable `sqlite` coordination authority. `local_test` is explicit and never a database-outage fallback.
- `SwarmMutexService` allocates lease epochs and fencing tokens as arbitrary-precision decimal strings under `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`.
- Memory, governed lock files, and Broccoli fences are projections. Release and reconciliation compare owner, epoch, token, and mode before cleanup.
- `AdministrativeLockCleaner` is the isolated ownership-override path; normal runtime cannot force-release a swarm.
- `TarjanDeadlockDetector` evaluates typed wait edges from an immutable scheduler snapshot and applies recovery only if scheduler/lane versions are unchanged.
- `task_completions` is the durable terminal-result source of truth across restart and multi-process delivery.
- **SQLite Storage & Memory Hardening (ADR-014)**:
  - `PRAGMA auto_vacuum = INCREMENTAL;` executes *before* `PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;` during DB initialization, and performs an automated `VACUUM;` header migration if initialized in non-autovacuum mode.
  - Multi-table retention policies cover all system tables (`task_lifecycle_records`, `task_lifecycle_events`, `task_completions`, `completion_attempts`, expired `branches`, unreferenced `swarm_lock_generations`, legacy `tasks`, CAS `files`, `telemetry`, `audit_events`, `agent_streams`, `agent_tasks`).
  - Prepared statement caching (`_rawStmtCache`) explicitly invokes `.dispose()` on evicted `better-sqlite3` handles to prevent native C++ memory leaks.
  - WAL checkpoints (`wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)`) run with exponential backoff retries when logs exceed 32MB or busy readers block truncation.

## Workspace Intelligence Engine

The Workspace Intelligence Engine is the code-level continuity subsystem introduced in this pass.

| Artifact | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/core/workspace-intelligence/types.ts` | Knowledge categories, drift findings, cognitive model schema, finalization input/result contracts |
| `src/core/workspace-intelligence/WorkspaceIntelligenceEngine.ts` | Discovers workspace evidence, classifies knowledge, detects drift, carries forward durable signals |
| `src/core/workspace-intelligence/WorkspaceIntelligenceStore.ts` | Persists the canonical JSON model and markdown projection under `.wiki/intelligence/` |
| `src/shared/completion/finalizationEvidence.ts` | Receipt evidence fields for intelligence artifacts and category counts |

Current integration point: `AutonomousDocumentationFinalizer.run()` invokes the engine after playbook generation and before migration-state stamping. The engine can also publish a summary to `KnowledgeGraphService` when that service is available.

## Agent Playbook And Living Wiki

The workspace now has two continuity layers:

| Layer | Path | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Root operating docs | `AGENT_PLAYBOOK.md`, `WIKI.md`, `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `HANDOFF.md` | Human/agent entry points committed at repository root |
| Generated/finalization wiki | `.wiki/`, especially `.wiki/agent/*` once generated by finalization | Session finalization evidence and agent handoff artifacts |

The finalizer writes managed sections so generated playbook content can be refreshed without deleting human-authored notes.

## Provider Contracts

Current provider truth comes from `src/shared/providers/providers.json` and `src/core/api/index.ts`:

| Provider key | Handler | UI label |
|---|---|---|
| `openrouter` | `OpenRouterHandler` | OpenRouter |
| `openai-codex` | `OpenAiCodexHandler` | ChatGPT Subscription |
| `nousResearch` | `NousResearchHandler` | NousResearch |
| `cloudflare` | `CloudflareHandler` | Cloudflare Workers AI |
| `cerebras` | `CerebrasHandler` | Cerebras |
| `cline-pass` | `ClinePassHandler` | ClinePass |
| `xai-oauth` | `XAIOauthHandler` | Grok/X Subscription |
| `qwen-token-plan` | `QwenTokenPlanHandler` | Qwen Token Plan |
| `zai` | `ZAiHandler` | Z AI (GLM) |

If docs say fewer than nine wired providers, they are stale.

## Setup And Environment

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Install all root and webview deps | `npm run install:all` |
| Build protobuf outputs | `npm run protos` |
| Compile production TypeScript | `npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false --project tsconfig.json` |
| Watch extension build | `npm run watch` |
| Run webview dev server | `npm run dev:webview` |
| Package VSIX | `npm run package:vsix` |
| Package VS Code and Open VSX targets | `npm run package:vsix:all` |

Node 22 is used in GitHub Actions. VS Code engine support is `^1.84.0`.

## Testing Strategy

| Surface | Command | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Full root quality | `npm run ci:check-all` | Parallel check-types/lint/docs/doctor checks |
| Production TS only | `npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false --project tsconfig.json` | Excludes e2e helper files |
| Unit tests | `npm run test:unit` | Uses `.mocharc.json`; can run many specs |
| Focused TS spec | `TS_NODE_PROJECT=./tsconfig.unit-test.json npx mocha --no-config ... <spec>` | Use to avoid loading every recursive spec |
| Integration tests | `npm run test:integration` | VS Code test runner |
| Webview tests | `cd webview-ui && npm run test` | Vitest |
| E2E | `npm run test:e2e:optimal` | Builds VSIX and runs Playwright |
| BroccoliDB guardrails | `cd broccolidb && npm run test:guardrails` | Substrate public API/docs guard |

## Deployment And Release

| Flow | Source |
|---|---|
| Local packaging | `npm run package:vsix`, `npm run package:vsix:openvsx`, `npm run package:vsix:all` |
| Tagged package workflow | `.github/workflows/package-extension.yml` |
| Manual publish workflow | `.github/workflows/publish.yml` |
| VS Code publish script | `scripts/publish-vscode.mjs` |
| Open VSX publish script | `scripts/publish-openvsx.mjs` |
| Native dependency doctor | `scripts/lumi-doctor.mjs`, `npm run doctor:ci` |

Release workflows build platform-targeted VSIX files and run doctor checks. Publishing uses VSCE and OVSX tokens.

## Coding Conventions

| Convention | Practical rule |
|---|---|
| Host isolation | Core code uses `HostProvider`; direct `vscode` belongs under host-specific paths |
| Tool routing | Add tools through `DietCodeDefaultTool`, prompt specs, coordinator registration, and handler tests |
| Provider routing | Add provider keys in both API routing and UI provider list |
| Generated code | Edit schemas/sources, then regenerate |
| Webview copy | Prefer `webview-ui/src/copy/lumiVoice.ts` when changing user-facing voice |
| Docs | Session behavior goes under `docs/`; substrate behavior goes under `broccolidb/docs/`; continuity goes in root operating docs |
| Architecture changes | Update `docs/architecture/current.md`, `docs/PROJECT_MAP.md`, and this file when boundaries move |

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| LUMI | User-facing VS Code extension |
| DietCode | Legacy/internal naming still present in code paths, settings, and storage keys |
| BroccoliDB | Local substrate package for context, runtime graph, Spider, snapshots |
| Completion spine | Snapshot -> decision -> action contract -> guard |
| Terminal CAS | `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction binding completion to the current lease generation and task state version |
| Coordination projection | Memory/file/Broccoli copy of an authoritative SQLite lease; never independent authority |
| Finalization lane | Same-session documentation/ledger path after engineering verification |
| Agent Playbook Method | Workspace-specific agent handoff pattern for reducing rediscovery |
| Workspace Intelligence Engine | Harness subsystem that turns finalization evidence and workspace inspection into classified durable knowledge |
| Governed swarm | Multi-agent execution with lane receipts, locks, merge gate, and coordinator commit |
| Roadmap projection | Private per-lane roadmap events plus coordinator-owned workspace commits |

## Master of Design (MoD) Architecture

Master of Design (MoD) is a toggleable LUMI execution mode for senior design-steered coding and implementation.

### Standard Coding vs Design (MoD) Behavior
- **Coding Mode**: Standard developer loop for direct code edits and terminal execution.
- **Design Mode (MoD)**: Runs on the exact same task loop with 100% tool parity (`read_file`, `replace_in_file`, `execute_command`, `browser_action`, subagents, MCP tools), automatically steered by senior design engineering instincts:
  1. *Design Token Sensing*: Inspecting CSS/Tailwind variables before modifying UI.
  2. *7-State UI Matrix*: Handling Idle, Hover, Active, Disabled, Loading, Empty, and Error boundaries.
  3. *WCAG 2.1 AA Standards*: Ensuring contrast >= 4.5:1, touch targets >= 44px, visible focus rings, and reduced motion fallbacks.
  4. *Visual Aesthetics*: Typographic scale, dark/light mode balance, glassmorphism, fluid micro-transitions.
  5. *Responsive Layout Ergonomics*: Mobile/desktop grid reflow without scrollbar leaks.
  6. *5-Whys Cognitive Ergonomics*: Usability friction reduction and clear CTA paths.

### Subagent Swarm Propagation
Subagent task swarms created while in MoD Mode automatically inherit `modEnabled: true` in their `SystemPromptContext` (`src/core/task/tools/subagent/SubagentRunner.ts`), ensuring subagent workers operate with senior design instincts.
1. Product intent & constraints
2. User safety and accessibility
3. Primary workflow impact
4. Existing product strengths
5. Evidence quality
6. Design-system coherence
7. Technical feasibility

### Decision Locking
Accepted design decisions are locked before mutation. Reopening a locked decision requires a specific justification (e.g. failed gate validation).

### Mutation Authority & Governance
Mutations are permitted only in **Plan-and-Implement** outcome mode and must remain within the approved boundaries. Overlapping parallel mutations are prohibited.

### Invariant Target Resolution Guard
Before task generation, `resolveTargetFilesForDecision()` validates target areas. If a decision targets `General` or `General Area` without deterministic workspace file evidence, it throws `TargetResolutionException`. Keyword-guessing fallbacks are banned to prevent hallucinated file edits. Failed resolutions cleanly block implementation with `[TARGET_RESOLUTION_FAILURE]` recorded in the run state limitations.

### Automatic Execution Strategy & Glassbox UI
- **Discerning Execution**: `determineEffectiveOutcome(requestText)` automatically determines whether execution proceeds (`plan-and-implement`) or defers (`plan-only`) based on request intent and task grounding, removing manual outcome buttons from the webview.
- **Glassbox Council Inspector**: Displays live specialist persona lenses, locked architectural decisions (`🔒`), governed code mutation tasks (`⚡`), 8-gate audit results (`🛡️`), and a 5-step visual pipeline indicator directly in the webview UI, eliminating generic spinners and uninformative status text.

### Completion Gates
Final results are audited against 8 gates: Product Intent, UX Architecture, Visual System, Interaction & State, Accessibility, Implementation Fidelity, Cross-Surface Consistency, and Final Product Critique (ensuring the final product does not feel generic or stitched together).

### Revision Behavior
A failed gate triggers a targeted revision pass. Only the responsible specialists are re-run. Revisions are capped at a strict budget of 2 passes, after which the parent must reduce scope, accept limitations, or fail honestly.

### Resume Behavior
MoD state is serialized in `mod_run_state.json` inside the task storage directory. Resuming a task restores the correct stage, preserves completed tasks, and avoids duplicate mutations.

### Telemetry & Failure Modes
Emits trace lifecycle events (e.g. `mod.started`, `mod.decision.locked`, `mod.gate.passed`). Stage failures route to an explicit `MoDFailure` state to exit cleanly.

### Known Limitations
- Does not run visual comparison engines on actual visual screenshots.
- Revision passes are limited to a text-based critique loop.

## Known Drift

| Drift | Source of truth |
|---|---|
| Some docs say four providers | Code/UI list five provider keys |
| Provider/version metrics have drifted historically | `src/core/api/index.ts`, `src/shared/providers/providers.json`, and `package.json` |
| `ROADMAP.md` contains stale bootstrap text | Maintained docs and implementation |
| `.wiki/00-forensics.md` refers to old DietCode/Spider state | Current code and fresh diagnostics |
