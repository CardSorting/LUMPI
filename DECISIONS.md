## ADR-016: Unified MoD Prompt Steering Toggle Architecture

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** The MoD framework previously used a dedicated backend orchestrator (`MixtureOfDesignersOrchestrator`) that bypassed the main coding agent task loop. This introduced redundant execution paths, maintenance complexity, and tool parity drift. All MoD requirements are fundamentally a mirror of the coding agent steered by senior designer instincts.

**Decision:** Refactor MoD in its entirety into a System Prompt Steering Toggle:
1. **Unified Task Execution Path**: MoD Mode runs through the standard coding task loop (`initiateTaskLoop` in `src/core/task/index.ts`) with 100% tool parity (`read_file`, `replace_in_file`, `execute_command`, `browser_action`, subagents, MCP tools).
2. **Dynamic Prompt Steering**: When `modEnabled` is `true`, `PromptBuilder.ts` automatically injects `MOD_DESIGNER_STEERING` (`src/core/prompts/system-prompt/components/mod_designer_steering.ts`) directly after `AGENT_ROLE_SECTION` for maximum attention weighting.
3. **6 Design Engineering Pillars**: Injects Design Token Sensing, Complete 7-State UI Matrix, WCAG 2.1 AA Accessibility, Visual Aesthetics, Responsive Layout Ergonomics, and 5-Whys Cognitive Analysis.
4. **Subagent Swarm Propagation**: `SubagentRunner.ts` propagates `modEnabled: true` down to subagent task contexts so subagent swarms inherit senior designer instincts seamlessly.
5. **Non-Technical UX Ergonomics**: Segmented control switcher (`ModModeSwitcher.tsx`) with zero-jargon copy, keyboard navigation, popover guides, and visual indicator badges.

**Consequences:**
- Centralizes core execution into a single, unified, highly optimized task loop.
- Guarantees 100% tool parity between Coding Mode and Design (MoD) Mode.
- Eliminates thousands of lines of redundant backend orchestration bypass code.

## ADR-015: LUMI Designer-in-Residence Enterprise Architecture & Governance

**Status:** Superseded by ADR-016

**Context:** The Mixture of Designers framework originally modeled design expertise as five isolated voting personas. World-class product design requires a Designer-in-Residence: a single senior product designer embedded in the workspace who moves fluidly across internal design lenses (UX Architecture, Accessibility, Visual Hierarchy, Interaction Patterns, System Engineering) while maintaining one coherent product vision.

**Decision:** Implement the LUMI Designer-in-Residence architecture in `src/core/orchestration/mod/`:
1. Single senior designer agent with 5-Whys recursive root-cause reasoning (`DesignerInResidence.ts`).
2. Industry Pattern Library Registry (`PatternLibrary.ts`) benchmarking UI issues against learned conventions (Command Palette, Split Workspace, Contextual Action Toolbar, Optimistic Undo Toast, Guided Empty State, Focus-Trapped Modals).
3. Design Token Sensing & Codemod Sync Engine (`ContextBuilder.ts`, `TokenSyncEngine.ts`) mapping hardcoded CSS/HEX values to canonical design tokens.
4. Dynamic UX Health Index (0-100) & Debt Graph (`DesignIntelligenceGraph.ts`).
5. Design Decision Records (`DesignDecisionRecord.ts`) and Design System Drift Guard (`DesignDriftDetector.ts`).
6. 8-State Interactive UI Component Contract Ledger (`ComponentContractLedger.ts`) and Predictive UX Regression Risk Calculator (`UXRegressionRiskCalculator.ts`).
7. Speculative Task Wave Planner (`SpeculativeTaskPlanner.ts`), Adaptive Circuit Breaker (`DesignCircuitBreaker.ts`), In-Memory State Cache (`DesignStateCache.ts`), and Fast-Path Atomic Decision Locking (`MixtureOfDesignersOrchestrator.ts`).

**Consequences:**
- Eliminates multi-agent persona voting overhead and consensus deadlocks.
- Provides immutable design governance logging (`DDR-001`) and automated CSS token codemod patches.
- Prevents breaking UI layout regressions via predictive risk scoring.
- Achieves high throughput via parallel disjoint task wave partitioning and non-blocking background I/O.

## ADR-001: Root continuity docs are the first agent entry point

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** The repository already had extensive user/developer docs and an older `.wiki`, but future agents needed a direct operating layer that separated current task state from stable architecture.

**Decision:** Maintain these root files:

- `AGENT_PLAYBOOK.md` for current agent operating guidance.
- `WIKI.md` for stable workspace architecture and workflows.
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for negative knowledge and reproduced failures.
- `DECISIONS.md` for root-level continuity decisions.
- `HANDOFF.md` for current working-tree state and next steps.

**Consequences:**

- Future agents can start at the root without scanning the whole docs tree.
- Stable knowledge and temporary handoff state have separate homes.
- Root docs must be kept concise and linked to deeper docs rather than duplicating them.

## ADR-002: Implementation beats stale documentation

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Some existing docs lagged current code. Examples found in this pass: provider count drift, stale roadmap bootstrap content, README version badge drift, and old `.wiki` DietCode/Spider claims.

**Decision:** When docs and implementation disagree, use implementation and manifests as source of truth, then update or flag stale docs.

**Consequences:**

- Provider truth comes from `src/core/api/index.ts` and `src/shared/providers/providers.json`; provider-count docs were corrected to 5 in this pass.
- Version truth comes from `package.json`; root README version references were corrected to 3.0.0 in this pass.
- Architecture truth comes from maintained docs plus current source layout.
- The roadmap and `.wiki` need explicit refresh passes before they can be treated as authoritative.

## ADR-003: Agent Playbook Method is both prompt contract and generated wiki artifact

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Human-oriented wiki notes did not reliably reduce future-agent rediscovery.

**Decision:** Embed the Agent Playbook Method in:

- system prompt wiki rules (`integrity_wiki.ts`),
- same-session finalization generation (`AutonomousDocumentationFinalizer.ts`),
- a workspace skill (`.agents/skills/agent-playbook-method/SKILL.md`),
- root operating docs (`AGENT_PLAYBOOK.md` and `HANDOFF.md`).

**Consequences:**

- Future finalization runs can create `.wiki/agent/*` files from workspace evidence.
- Manual wiki/playbook work has a project skill and root standard.
- Generated wiki sections should be managed and replaceable, not endlessly appended.

## ADR-004: Completion/finalization policy stays centralized

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** The completion lifecycle decision engine was added to prevent stale audit reuse, duplicate retry loops, and agent misinterpretation.

**Decision:** New completion eligibility behavior must go through the snapshot -> decision -> action contract -> action guard spine.

**Consequences:**

- Do not add completion/finalization routing policy directly in handlers.
- Tests should verify decision output and guard behavior.
- Finalization documentation work happens after engineering verification via `run_finalization`.
- Eligibility and terminal durability remain separate: a successful decision is not terminal until the SQLite `task_completions` CAS commits.

## ADR-005: Use focused validation before broad validation in constrained environments

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Broad mocha can load unrelated tests and hit sandbox-only failures, such as roadmap progress writes under `~/.dietcode/session`.

**Decision:** For a small change, run a focused spec with `--no-config`, then production typecheck and style checks. Run broad suites when the environment supports their filesystem requirements.

**Consequences:**

- Final responses should report both focused proof and broad-suite limitations.
- Sandbox failures should be documented in `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`.
- Do not hide unrelated failures; classify them.

## ADR-006: Keep LUMI session and BroccoliDB substrate docs separate

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** The monorepo contains the extension session layer and a substrate package with its own public API and docs.

**Decision:** Root and `docs/` should describe LUMI session behavior and link to BroccoliDB docs for substrate details. BroccoliDB-specific architecture belongs under `broccolidb/docs/`.

**Consequences:**

- `WIKI.md` can map the two layers but should not duplicate BroccoliDB internals.
- BroccoliDB changes should run BroccoliDB package tests and update BroccoliDB docs.

## ADR-007: Workspace Intelligence Engine is a finalization subsystem

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Prompt/wiki instructions and manual memory are not enough to preserve engineering intelligence. Completed tasks need a harness-owned learning pass that classifies durable knowledge, detects drift, and persists a structured cognitive model.

**Decision:** Add `src/core/workspace-intelligence/` as a first-class subsystem invoked by `AutonomousDocumentationFinalizer` during `run_finalization`. The engine writes a canonical `.wiki/intelligence/workspace-intelligence.json`, a scan-friendly markdown projection, optional BroccoliDB cognitive memory entries, and receipt evidence fields.

**Consequences:**

- Workspace intelligence is now part of the completion/finalization contract, not only prompt guidance.
- Knowledge is classified as permanent, operational, historical, failure, or predictive.
- Drift findings and category counts travel with finalization evidence.
- Future improvements should expand discovery signals and lifecycle hooks through this subsystem rather than scattering continuity logic across handlers.

## Open Decision Items

| Item | Needed evidence |
|---|---|
| Whether `ROADMAP.md` should be regenerated or manually repaired | Roadmap audit/checkpoint output and maintainer preference |
| Whether root continuity docs should be included in docs CI | Link-check scope and release policy |
| Whether `.wiki/00-forensics.md` should be replaced by generated current-state sections | Fresh Spider/roadmap diagnostics |
| Whether Workspace Intelligence should also observe task-start/tool-execution phases | Design pass over task lifecycle hooks, storage volume, and privacy constraints |

## ADR-008: Structuring Workspace Intelligence around Provenance and Query Services

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Storing raw unstructured conclusions makes facts opaque and prevents future tasks from validating why a subsystem was marked volatile or risky.

**Decision:** Commit to a two-phase evolution for the Workspace Intelligence subsystem:
1. **Provenance & Auditing:** Every derived fact/signal stored in the cognitive model must preserve its evidence trail (provenance metadata, e.g., finalization run, specific manifest, verification artifacts, or ADR file links) to answer *why* it is believed.
2. **Query Service Interface:** Evolve the architecture from a monolithic model object to a queryable domain service exposing dedicated APIs (e.g., `getSubsystemHealth()`, `getRecurringFailurePatterns()`, `getMostVolatileAreas()`) rather than expanding the schema indefinitely.

**Consequences:**
- Conclusions remain auditable by both humans and subsequent agent instances.
- Downstream features (planning, completion guidance, roadmap steering) consume structured queries rather than raw JSON structures.

## ADR-009: Fact Lifecycle Management for Workspace State Infrastructure

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Over time, workspace facts can linger, accumulate, or become outdated, leading to drift between the persisted cognitive model and the actual codebase.

**Decision:** Evolve the Workspace Intelligence subsystem to support a explicit fact lifecycle:
1. **Lifecycle States:** Define `WorkspaceFactLifecycle` as `"active" | "stale" | "superseded" | "disputed" | "archived"`.
2. **Management Queries:** Extend the query service to expose operations like `explainFact(factId)`, `getStaleFacts()`, and `supersedeFact(oldFactId, newFactId)` to handle conflict resolution and deprecate old conclusions.

**Consequences:**
- The intelligence reader is robust against stale assertions.
- Subsequent tasks can dynamically update or dispute existing facts based on new execution evidence.

## ADR-010: Transitioning from State Surfaces to a Unified Workspace Knowledge Schema and Projections

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Treating the workspace intelligence model as a set of flat "state surfaces" restricts scalability. Adding new categories (e.g. dependency graphs, ownership, test coverage) forces schema changes and pollutes the storage layer with raw presentation structures.

**Decision:** Formally define the subsystem as a **Workspace Knowledge System** and decouple storage from presentation:
1. **Unified Storage Schema:** Define a normalized database model consisting of a collection of `WorkspaceFact` entities (containing `id`, `value`, `confidence`, `provenance[]`, and `lifecycle` fields) and their relationships.
2. **Projections as Views:** Redefine the current state surfaces (e.g., `volatileSubsystems`, `stableSubsystems`) as dynamic "views" or "projections" computed by the Query Layer over the core facts database, rather than hardcoding them in the storage schema.
3. **Reasoning Invariant:** Enforce that the knowledge system only records deterministic execution evidence and parsed repository signals. Planning, heuristic interpretation, and reasoning remain the sole responsibility of the active planning model/agent, keeping the data layer clean and auditable.

**Consequences:**
- The knowledge layer can expand to capture new engineering dimensions (dependency maturity, code coverage, performance hotspots) without database migrations.
- Producers (finalizers, observers) write normalized facts, while consumers (wiki projection, agent playbook, system prompt) retrieve query-driven views.

## ADR-011: SQLite is the sole production coordination authority

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Treating memory, files, and SQLite as peer lock authorities makes database outages and stale projections ambiguous. Numeric fencing tokens also lose identity precision at large generations.

**Decision:** Fix coordination mode at startup. Production uses `sqlite`; `local_test` is explicit and never selected as a fallback. Allocate epochs/tokens under `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, store them as decimal `TEXT`, and treat memory/file/Broccoli state as projections of the SQLite lease. Isolate ownership overrides in `AdministrativeLockCleaner`.

**Consequences:** Database outages retry or fail closed, exact old-owner tuples cannot release newer leases, projection cleanup cannot revert a committed database release, and emergency cleanup is explicit and logged.

## ADR-012: Deadlock recovery requires a versioned typed wait-for snapshot

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Cycles and capacity pressure can resolve through timers, lease expiry, outside owners, or unrelated running work. A diagnosis becomes unsafe if scheduler state changes before recovery.

**Decision:** Build typed wait edges from one immutable scheduler/lane snapshot, run Tarjan SCC on hard edges, require no valid escape transition, and re-check both state versions before recovery.

**Consequences:** Ordinary contention/backoff does not trigger false recovery, true self/dependency/ownership cycles remain detectable, and stale diagnoses are discarded.

## ADR-013: Terminal completion is a durable lease/state CAS

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** In-memory duplicate suppression cannot survive restart or serialize competing completion attempts.

**Decision:** Canonically hash task, evaluated state version, checkpoint, outcome, and decision schema version. Persist one `task_completions` row under `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` after verifying the live lease tuple, freshest generation, and unchanged task state version.

**Consequences:** Restart delivery is idempotent, same-outcome duplicates are suppressed, competing outcomes conflict visibly, and stale owners cannot terminalize.

## ADR-014: SQLite Storage Retention & Memory Lifecycle Hardening

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Continuous long-running subagent execution without storage retention caps leads to exponential database file bloat, disk erosion, checkpoint binary bloat, native `sqlite3_stmt` handle leaks, and V8 array allocation memory leaks.

**Decision:** Enforce a multi-layered SQLite retention and memory architecture:
1. **Universal Retention Sweeps**: Complete retention policies covering all system tables (`nodes`, `trees`, `stashes`, `agent_streams`, `agent_tasks`, legacy `tasks`, `agent_cognitive_snapshots`, `telemetry`, `task_lifecycle_events`, `task_lifecycle_records`, `task_completions`, `task_rejections`, `completion_attempts`, expired `branches`, and unreferenced `swarm_lock_generations`) with automatic orphan CAS file and edge garbage collection.
2. **Auto-Vacuum PRAGMA Ordering & Reclaiming**: Ensure `PRAGMA auto_vacuum = INCREMENTAL;` executes BEFORE `PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;` during DB initialization, running an automatic `VACUUM;` header migration if a DB was initialized in non-autovacuum mode. Freelist vacuuming loop returns freed pages to OS (`incremental_vacuum` until `freelist_count === 0`).
3. **Resilient WAL Checkpointing**: Enforce automated WAL truncation (`wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)`) with exponential backoff retries when WAL logs exceed 32 MB or busy readers block checkpoints.
4. **Native Prepared Statement Handle Disposal**: Prepared statement caching via `_rawStmtCache` (LRU eviction and connection `destroyDb()` teardown) explicitly calls `.dispose()` on `better-sqlite3` statements to eliminate native C++ memory handle leaks. Hot-path persistence layers (`TaskLifecyclePersistence`, `SwarmMutexService`, `CompletionFunnel`) consume `getCachedStatement`.
5. **Buffer Pooling & Garbage Collection**: Parameter-bounded chunking in `BufferedDbPool` (dynamically capped to parameter buffer bounds), with bounded ring-buffer latency tracking to eliminate array allocation pressure.
6. **Binary Exclusion**: Binary database exclusion in `CheckpointExclusions.ts` (`*.db`, `*.db-wal`, `*.db-shm`, `*.sqlite3`) to prevent Git checkpoint bloat.

**Consequences:** Prevents unbounded disk growth, eliminates native statement handle and V8 array allocation memory leaks, prevents lock timeouts (`busy_timeout = 5000`), and keeps SQLite query latencies sub-millisecond.
