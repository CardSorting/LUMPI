Format:
------- SEARCH

Rules:
1. SEARCH block must match file section EXACTLY (character-for-character, whitespace, indentation).
2. Order multiple blocks top-to-bottom as they appear in the file.
3. Keep SEARCH blocks concise to unique lines only. No mid-line truncations.
4. Delete code: Empty REPLACE block. Move code: Delete + insert block.`;
