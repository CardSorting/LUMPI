# Governed Execution Operator Runbook

SRE-style playbook for governed swarm receipts: triage incidents, interpret violations, recover safely, and decide when retry is allowed.

## On-call quick reference

**North-star:** Locks protect mutation. Receipts preserve forensic truth. The coordinator owns live authority — [governed execution authority](governed-execution-authority.md).

**Roadmap:** Private projection state is cheap. Workspace roadmap truth is expensive. Only the coordinator may spend it.

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Where is truth? | Last `sealed && mergePassed` in `{swarmId}.governed.history.jsonl`, or `loadAuthoritativeGovernedReceipt()` |
| Is "lock skipped" a bug? | **No** — expected for read/audit/plan/doc/diagnostic lanes |
| Is missing `claimId` a bug? | Only if `executionMode: mutation` or lane performed writes |
| Can two lanes read the same file? | **Yes** — read overlap is not a violation |
| Can lanes mutate workspace roadmap directly? | **No** — use `propose_patch`; coordinator commits after reconciliation |
| What changes workspace roadmap? | `commitWorkspaceRoadmapPatches` under `roadmap:workspace` lock after seal |
| When is retry safe? | `diagnostics.retrySafe === true` in incident console |
| What blocks merge? | `mergeGate.violations` only; `advisoryWarnings` never block — see [violation catalog](#violation-catalog) |
| Should I retry the swarm? | Follow `retryDisposition`; never infer retry scope from warning text |
| What if SQLite is down? | Treat as `DATABASE_AUTHORITY_UNAVAILABLE`; retry at a safe boundary or fail closed |
| Can I delete a stale-looking lock file? | No. Reconcile against SQLite, or use the isolated administrative cleaner with an override reason |

---

## Authoritative state procedure

Chat status and latest pointer can lie after a failed retry. Use this procedure:

1. Open `{taskDir}/subagent_executions/{swarmId}.governed.history.jsonl`
2. Scan **from bottom** for first entry with `sealed: true` and `mergePassed: true`
3. Load `{swarmId}.governed.{attemptId}.json` for that `attemptId`
4. Or call `loadAuthoritativeGovernedReceipt(taskId, swarmId)`

**Latest pointer rule:** `{swarmId}.governed.json` is **not updated** when a new attempt fails seal but a prior attempt sealed successfully.

---

## Incident taxonomy

Derived by `deriveReceiptIncident()` (priority order). Use **Symptom → Diagnosis → Action**.

| Incident | Symptoms | Diagnosis | Action |
|----------|----------|-----------|--------|
| **sealed_success** | Green seal, merge ok | Gate passed, replay valid | Treat swarm as complete |
| **in_progress** | Lanes running, live summary | Execution not sealed | Wait; do not merge or retry over |
| **partial_receipt** | Unsealed, lanes `running`, `retryReason` crash prefix | Interrupt before seal | Inspect claim timeline; recover stale mutation claims; retry with `parentAttemptId` |
| **stale_claim** | Stale count > 0, `stale_detected` in history | Expired lease / stale file or fence | Run [stale recovery](#stale-recovery-procedure) |
| **unsafe_retry** | Supersession violation | Retry would overwrite sealed success | Link via `parentAttemptId`; do not delete sealed attempt |
| **merge_blocked** | Violations list non-empty | Reconciliation failed | [Violation catalog](#violation-catalog) → fix → retry |
| **replay_mismatch** | Checksum / integrity invalid | Receipt or envelope drift | Forensic compare; re-run from authoritative attempt |
| **corrupted_receipt** | Schema validation failed | Malformed JSON or wrong version | Inspect file on disk; do not merge |
| **backend_unavailable** | Durable layer missing | DB/workspace unavailable | Fix workspace/DB; re-admit |
| **failed_receipt** | Sealed false, no other class | General failure | Full receipt review |

## Lock necessity (operator)

### Console signals

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Mode badge (`read_only`, …) | Declared execution mode |
| **lock skipped** (green) | No governed ownership; safe read/audit lane |
| **lock required** (blue) | Mutation or escalated lane |
| `read:N` | Read set size |
| `write:N` | Write set size — attention if lock skipped |
| No claim ID | Expected when lock skipped |

**Do not escalate** lock-skipped lanes as "missing lock."

### Lock decision matrix

| Condition | Lock |
|-----------|------|
| `mutation` (default) | Required |
| `[write_set:…]` | Required (escalated) |
| `[declares_writes]`, `[mutates_roadmap]`, `[mutates_broccoli]` | Required |
| `[updates_authoritative_receipt]`, `[exclusive_resource:…]` | Required |
| Read/audit/plan/doc/diagnostic, no escalation | **Skipped** |

### Parallel safety matrix

| Scenario | Merge collision? |
|----------|------------------|
| Two `read_only` lanes read `src/a.ts` | No |
| Two `audit_only` lanes inspect same receipt | No |
| Two `planning_only` lanes reference same roadmap item | No |
| `diagnostic_only` append-only evidence | No |
| Two `mutation` lanes write `src/a.ts` in parallel | **Yes** — `unsafe mutation overlap` |
| Non-mutating lane ran write tools without lock | **Yes** — `performed writes without lock` |
| Dependent lane writes after predecessor (DAG order) | No — allowed when deps wired |

---

## Roadmap projection (operator)

### Three planes at a glance

| Plane | Operator signal | Safe to ignore? |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Agent | `agentRoadmapId`, `local:N`, `patches:N` on lane row | Yes — private state |
| Swarm | `swarm plan: N lanes` | Yes — linkage only |
| Workspace | `workspace snap`, `commit:`, accepted/rejected counts | **No** — authoritative |

### Reading the Roadmap planes section

| UI line | Meaning | Action if wrong |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| `workspace snap: rm-snap-…` | Current workspace snapshot at seal | Compare to lane `roadmapSnapshotId` |
| `accepted patches: N` | Patches passed reconciliation | Expect > 0 for roadmap updates |
| `rejected patches: N` | Failed quality/rebase/conflict | Read rejection reasons |
| `rebase {id}: rebased` | Patch safely rebased to current snapshot | Normal when workspace moved during run |
| `rebase {id}: stale_conflict` | Stale patch cannot apply | Retry lane with fresh projection |
| `Rejected patch reasons` | Why each patch failed | Fix evidence, rationale, or target item |
| `commit: blocked` | Workspace not updated | See `workspaceCommit.blockReason` on receipt |
| `commit: committed` | Coordinator applied patches | Verify kanban state |
| `commit: skipped` | Roadmap disabled or no actionable patches | Expected for file-only swarms |
| `stale projections: …` | Projection out of sync | Re-run affected lanes |

### Per-lane projection signals

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `patches:N` | Lane proposed N workspace patches |
| `local:N` | Lane recorded N private local events |
| Truncated `agent-rm:…` | Projection ID (hover for full) |
| `directWorkspaceRoadmapMutation` on receipt | **P1** — agent bypassed patch model |

### Patch rejection reasons (common)

| Reason pattern | Cause | Fix |
|----------------|-------|-----|
| `missing evidence pointer` | `mark_complete` without `evidence=` | Add `[propose_patch:…:evidence=path]` |
| `vague or missing rationale` | Rationale too short or generic | Use specific rationale ≥ 8 chars |
| `insufficient confidence` | `confidence` < 0.5 | Set `confidence=0.8` or higher |
| `stale conflicting patch` | `mark_complete` on old snapshot | Re-acquire lane or use `attach_evidence` first |
| `failed lane cannot mark roadmap complete` | Failed lane proposed completion | Fix lane or use advisory patch |
| `conflicting workspace patches` | Two lanes incompatible on same item | Add DAG dependency or split items |
| `smuggled authoritative mutation via local event` | Mutation language in local event | Use `propose_patch` instead |

### Coordinator commit blocked

Check receipt `roadmapLinkage.workspaceCommit.blockReason`:

| blockReason | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| `merge gate did not pass` | Fix merge violations first |
| `roadmap patch reconciliation failed` | Fix rejected patches |
| `receipt not sealed` | Partial/crash receipt |
| `receipt integrity invalid` | Replay mismatch |
| `no actionable patches to commit` | Only advisory patches or none proposed |
| `completion policy advisory_only blocks mark_complete commit` | Enable policy or use advisory |
| `coordinator failed to acquire roadmap:workspace lock` | Stale lock — recover `roadmap:workspace` |
| `roadmap disabled` | `commitStatus: skipped` — expected |

**No lane-level workspace commit path exists.** If workspace roadmap changed without `workspaceCommit.committed: true`, investigate out-of-band writes.

---

## Retry decision flow

### Retry dispositions

| Value | Operator action |
|-------|-----------------|
| `not_needed` | Accept the seal. Advisory enrichment may happen later; do not rerun completed work. |
| `targeted_repair` | Repair/resume only affected lanes and dependent descendants. Preserve successful lane artifacts. |
| `retry_after_recovery` | Reconcile claims, leases, or coordinator state first; then retry only incomplete work. |
| `do_not_retry` | Use authoritative sealed state or create an explicitly linked child attempt. |

### Parent continuation

`continuationDecision` is the sole final parent action. Downstream presentation may render advisories but must not reinterpret findings or retry dispositions. A clean accepted receipt uses `accept`; a safe receipt with warnings uses `accept_with_advisories`; localized defects use `targeted_repair`; coordination interruption uses `recover_and_resume`; hard ownership conflicts use `halt_for_conflict`; corrupt immutable results use `reject_invalid_result`.

### Live parent-flow policy

| Control | Runtime behavior | Operator implication |
|---------|------------------|----------------------|
| Concurrency | At most 3 active model requests through a priority-aware bulkhead pool (FIFO within equal priority; 1 slot reserved for fast I/O when waiting) | Capacity is bounded; non-mutating lanes cannot be starved by mutation lanes; backoff releases slots |
| Approval | Read permission and read/diagnostic tools for non-mutating lanes; edit permission or one approval for mutation | Inner lane I/O does not prompt repeatedly after authority is granted |
| DAG priority | Weighted longest ready downstream path (read-only/diagnostic boost) | Lanes that unblock more work and fast I/O authority lanes may start before lower-index lanes |
| Status persistence | Latest state coalesced to 250 ms; partial running progress is UI-only | Disk writes at terminal staging/seal only; parent stops progress I/O before sealing |
| Artifact writes | Invocation-ordered per swarm, atomic temp-file replacement, unsealed staging marker | Different swarms persist concurrently; readers never see torn JSON or resume pre-seal state |
| Control-plane I/O | Progress/UI best-effort with 2 s UI bounds; preflight overlaps execution with a 10 s bound; child-stream registration gates no lane | Required joins occur at the terminal seal barrier, not worker startup |
| Attempt timeout | 5 minutes, bounded by the 20-minute swarm deadline | A lane cannot extend the parent deadline through retries |
| Retry | Transient failures only, 3 total attempts, capped full jitter; locks released during backoff | Auth, budget, iteration, cancellation, and deterministic task failures do not retry |
| Lane pipeline | Slot → claim → run; active executions capped (capacity + 1); scheduler wakes on slot release | Retry backoff frees slots and active execution capacity for other lanes |
| Attempt isolation | Fresh runner/model client; 2-second abort grace before replacement | No overlapping replacement if the prior attempt cannot quiesce |
| Parent budget | Tokens/cost accumulated across attempts | Retry spend is visible and an aggregate cost crossing fails the crossing lane |
| Fast I/O throughput | Non-mutating lanes may parallelize independent tool calls when parent setting allows | Read/diagnostic lanes batch reads while every call retains one [central execution funnel](parent-thread-execution-authority.md) event |
| Dependency failure | Propagated immediately to downstream pending lanes | Independent lanes continue; blocked descendants fail with upstream IDs |

Worker lanes cannot spawn verifier lanes. A worker emits `SIGNAL: REVIEW_REQUESTED`; the parent schedules review if needed. Shared `.wiki/` writes belong to an explicitly assigned documentation lane or parent finalization.

### isRetrySafe() conditions

**Unsafe when:**

- Any `resourceOwners` with `status: active`
- Any `status: stale` (must recover first)
- `mergeGate.sealedSupersessionBlocked`
- Prior sealed attempt exists and current DAG has `running` nodes

**Safe when:** none of the above.

Lock-skipped lanes from prior attempt impose **no** claim cleanup.

## Violation catalog

Exact strings from `MergeGate.runMergeGate()`. Use for log search and alert routing.

### Mutation safety

| Violation pattern | Meaning | Remediation |
|-------------------|---------|-------------|
| `unsafe mutation overlap on '{path}': {agents}` | Parallel writes to same path | Serialize lanes, add DAG dep, or split write sets |
| `mutation lane {laneId} missing governed lock` | Mutation mode without claim | Bug or bypassed acquire — inspect handler |
| `mutation lane {laneId} performed writes without lock` | Write tools ran without claim | Ensure mutation acquire succeeded |
| `non-mutating lane {laneId} ({mode}) performed writes without lock` | Mode/write mismatch | Add `[write_set:…]` and accept lock, or fix lane tools |

### Audit advisories (non-blocking)

| Advisory pattern | Follow-up |
|------------------|-----------|
| `missing evidence: {agentIds}` | Ensure agents record `evidenceRefs` |
| `missing transcript pointer: {laneIds}` | Completed lanes need `transcriptArtifactPath` |
| `missing tool evidence: {laneIds}` | Completed lanes need tool steps or evidence |
| `unresolved placeholders: {agentIds}` | Remove TODO/FIXME/PLACEHOLDER/TBD from output |

These signals remain audit-visible but do not fail a safe merge. Enrich evidence or repair transcript persistence asynchronously; do not rerun the whole swarm solely for these findings.

### Status integrity

| Violation pattern | Remediation |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `lane {laneId} marked completed but agent status is failed` | Reconcile lane vs envelope status |
| `failed lane marked successful in envelope: {laneId}` | Same |
| `failed lanes: {laneIds}` | Fix or exclude failed lanes before seal |
| `unsealed DAG nodes: {laneIds}` | All nodes must be `sealed` or `failed` at seal |

### Ownership (mutation lanes only)

| Violation pattern | Remediation |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `orphaned claims: {count}` | Release or recover — filter `lockRequired` lanes |
| `unreleased claims: {laneIds}` | Call release path; check crash phase |
| `stale leases: {count}` | Unresolved stale ownership only; run stale recovery. A matching later `released` event clears the gate. |
| `duplicate claim on '{resource}': {a}, {b}` | Split-brain acquire — recover stale |
| `duplicate claimId '{id}' on resources '…' and '…'` | Claim ID collision — forensic claim history |
| `split-brain lock authority detected` | Multiple owner:token per resource |

### Lineage and replay

| Violation pattern | Remediation |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `unsealed retry cannot supersede prior sealed receipt` | Set `parentAttemptId`; complete or fail all DAG nodes |
| `replay checksum mismatch — non-deterministic state detected` | Receipt edited post-seal or envelope drift |
| `swarm id mismatch: …` / `task id mismatch: …` | Align artifact IDs |
| `lane count mismatch: …` | Lane receipts vs replay lineage |
| Replay schema violations | `unsupported replay schema`, `missing artifact id`, etc. |

### Roadmap projection

| Violation pattern | Remediation |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `agent {id} cannot directly mutate workspace roadmap — emit proposedWorkspacePatch` | Use `[propose_patch:…]`; never write workspace kanban from lane |
| `agent {id} smuggled authoritative mutation via local event: …` | Move intent to `propose_patch` or remove mutation phrasing from local events |
| `conflicting workspace patches on '{itemId}': {a}, {b}` | Serialize via DAG dependency or split target items |
| `unsafe roadmap mutation overlap` | Legacy direct-write audit — use projection model |
| `roadmap mutation without claim` | Legacy audit — use patch proposals |
| `lock-skipped lane … mutated roadmap` | Fix execution mode or route through patches |

Patch rejections are recorded in `roadmapLinkage.patchReconciliation.rejectedPatches` and surfaced as `diagnostics.rejectedPatchReasons`. Combined with direct-mutation flags, they block seal.

## Stale recovery procedure

Applies to **mutation lanes** with durable locks. Lock-skipped lanes: skip.

1. **Incident console** — note stale claims, ownership conflicts, projection corruption, and database health.
2. **Require SQLite availability** — reconciliation must read the authoritative lease. If unavailable, stop; do not inspect file age and infer ownership.
3. **Capture one reconciliation snapshot** — SQLite lease plus memory, file, and Broccoli projections.
4. **Validate every identity** — `ownerId`, `leaseEpoch`, `fencingToken`, and `authorityMode` must agree. A projection with a newer token, incompatible mode, malformed JSON, or `expiresAt < claimedAt` fails closed.
5. **Apply the database decision first:**
   - live SQLite lease: retain it and repair missing/stale projections;
   - expired SQLite lease: delete it by the full identity tuple, then clean matching projections;
   - no SQLite lease: remove only projections whose absence was confirmed against that snapshot.
6. **Confirm** the claim timeline reports `released`, `recovered`, or a projection repair and re-check `isRetrySafe`.

The file fallback predicate is used only when a structurally valid record has no `expiresAt`: `heartbeatAt ?? claimedAt` plus the configured stale duration. A future `expiresAt` always wins over file age. Normal runtime never unlinks malformed records automatically.

### Administrative cleanup

`src/core/governance/AdministrativeLockCleaner.ts` is the only ownership-override path. It is intentionally absent from `LockAuthority` and normal swarm flow.

Use it only after preserving evidence and establishing that ordinary database-backed reconciliation cannot complete the operational recovery. The caller must provide a non-empty override reason. The cleaner logs each SQLite, memory, file, and Broccoli record it unlinks. Never replace this procedure with direct `rm` of lock files.

### Database authority outage

| Symptom | Required response |
|---------|-------------------|
| Connection/open/query failure | Surface `DATABASE_AUTHORITY_UNAVAILABLE` (`retry`) |
| Reconciliation snapshot cannot read SQLite | Return no reclamation actions |
| Existing file/memory projection appears free | Ignore it as authority; do not acquire locally |
| Retry budget exhausted | Fail closed and preserve all records for later reconciliation |

---

## Claim timeline

| Event | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `admitted` | Roadmap allowed swarm |
| `acquired` | Mutation claim succeeded |
| `released` | Claim cleared via `UnifiedLockAuthority` |
| `rejected` | Acquire failed — check backend tags |
| `stale_detected` | Stale owner — recover before retry |
| `recovered` | Stale lock reclaimed |

**Lock-skipped lanes never appear** in acquired/released — they never held ownership.

### Backend tags (resource ownership row)

| Tag | Layer |
|-----|-------|
| `proc` | In-process |
| `db` | SwarmMutex |
| `lease` | Roadmap |
| `file` | File lock |
| `fence` | Broccoli fence |

Partial acquire (SQLite committed, file or fence projection failed) → **rejected**; the exact SQLite lease is ownership-checked and abandoned. A changed SQLite identity is never deleted.

---

## Crash phases

| Phase | Receipt signal | Orphan / unreleased? |
|-------|----------------|----------------------|
| After claim, before execution | Partial, lane `running` | Orphan if mutation |
| During execution | Partial | — |
| After execution, before release | Unreleased claim violation | Mutation only |
| After release, before seal | Unsealed, may lack evidence | No |
| Lock-skipped lane any phase | Lane receipt `lockRequired: false` | **No** |
| Parent before merge gate | Live `in_progress` summary | — |
| Failed retry after sealed success | Failed attempt file; pointer unchanged | Prior sealed authoritative |

`SubagentToolHandler` invokes `sealCrashReceipt()` on timeout, abort, or parent interruption — crash phase inferred via `inferSwarmCrashPhase`. Authoritative sealed success is preserved by `shouldUpdateLatestPointer` in `GovernedExecutionStore`.

---

## Replay checksum mismatch

**Hashed fields:** `swarmId`, `executionId`, `taskId`, `admission`, lane status + sorted `touchedFiles`, `mergePassed`, replay artifact ID/status.

**Not hashed:** lock fields, `executionMode`, `readSet`, `writeSet`, `claimHistory`.

### Common causes

| Cause | Check |
|-------|-------|
| Receipt edited after seal | File mtime vs `sealedAt` |
| Envelope mutated | Compare `{swarmId}.json` to seal-time copy |
| Lane count drift | `laneReceipts.length` vs replay lineage |
| ID drift | `taskId` / `swarmId` mismatch strings |

Use `explainReplayMismatch()` output in incident console.

## Harness author checklist

1. **Read-only review** — `[execution_mode:read_only]` + `[read_set:…]`
2. **Audit** — `[execution_mode:audit_only]`; no lock expected
3. **Doc edit** — `[write_set:…]` or `mutation` mode
4. **Default** — omit tag = mutation = lock required
5. **Parallel reads** — safe across read_only lanes
6. **Parallel writes** — require mutation + non-overlapping write sets or DAG order
7. **Roadmap updates** — `[propose_patch:…]` with `evidence=`, `rationale=`, `confidence=`; no direct workspace writes
8. **Local progress** — `[local_roadmap:progress_note:ITEM:…]` for private notes only
9. **Mark complete** — `[propose_patch:mark_complete:ITEM:evidence=path|rationale=…|confidence=0.9]`

## Forensic artifact locations

```
{taskDir}/subagent_executions/
  {swarmId}.json                          # envelope
  {swarmId}.governed.{attemptId}.json     # immutable receipt
  {swarmId}.governed.history.jsonl        # attempt index
  {swarmId}.governed.json                 # latest pointer (may lag)
  {swarmId}/agents/{agentId}.transcript.jsonl

{workspace}/.broccolidb/governed/
  locks/{sha256(resourceKey)}.lock
  fencing/{sha256(resourceKey)}.json
```

## Escalation guide

| Severity | Condition | Escalate to |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| P3 | Single merge violation, clear fix | Harness author / retry |
| P2 | Stale claims persist after recovery | Platform — lock backend health |
| P2 | `DATABASE_AUTHORITY_UNAVAILABLE` persists | Platform — SQLite health; do not switch authority modes |
| P2 | `split-brain lock authority detected` | Platform — forensic claim history |
| P1 | Data loss suspected (authoritative receipt missing) | Stop merges; preserve `history.jsonl` |
| P1 | Repeated fence fail-closed with DB up | BroccoliDB / workspace integrity |

---

## Quick diagnostic checklist

1. **Lane receipts** — is `lock skipped` expected for this mode?
2. **Overlap violation** — is it `unsafe mutation overlap` (writes), not reads?
3. **Orphaned claims** — filter to `lockRequired: true` lanes only
4. **Non-mutating blocked** — did lane run write tools? Fix mode or add write_set
5. **Authoritative state** — `history.jsonl` sealed entry, not chat or latest pointer alone
6. **Retry** — `diagnostics.retrySafe` before re-run
7. **Roadmap projection** — check accepted vs rejected patches before assuming kanban updated
8. **Workspace commit** — `diagnostics.roadmapCommitStatus` must be `committed` for patch-driven updates
9. **Authority health** — SQLite snapshot available; no dynamic local fallback
10. **Projection integrity** — exact owner/epoch/token/mode match; malformed records preserved
