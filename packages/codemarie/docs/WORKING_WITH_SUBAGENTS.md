# Working with Sub-agents

LUMI can spawn **subagents** — isolated agent runs with their own prompts, tools, and optional model configuration — through the `use_subagents` tool and dynamic subagent tool names.

`ToolExecutorCoordinator` registers static tools from `DietCodeDefaultTool` and **dynamic subagent handlers** loaded at runtime.

## How it works

1. The main `Task` calls `use_subagents` with agent type(s) and prompts.
2. The parent classifies lane authority and requests one batch approval at the required read/mutation level.
3. `SubagentBuilder` constructs an isolated model client for each attempt.
4. `SubagentRunner` registers and activates a unique child lifecycle task through the same `TaskLifecycleFunnel` as the parent.
5. A FIFO pool allows three active model requests; queued and retry-backoff lanes consume no active slot.
6. `SubagentRunner` executes the child loop with lane-scoped tools; non-mutating lanes cannot invoke write, command, MCP, memory-mutation, or repair tools.
7. The child settles completion, cancellation, failure, or timeout through the shared lifecycle authority before publishing its terminal envelope.
8. The parent stops progress I/O, atomically stages the artifact, reconciles receipts, publishes the sealed terminal artifact, and returns synthesized output.

Scheduler recovery uses an immutable, versioned wait-for snapshot. Dependency and ownership cycles are reported as deadlocks only when timers, lease expiry, outside resource owners, and unrelated capacity cannot resolve them. The state version is checked again before recovery is applied.

## Agent types

Subagent configs can specify types such as `worker`, `verifier`, and `researcher` (see `Orchestrator` task traces). Each type can carry different tool allowlists and completion gates (`subagentCompletionGates.ts`).

## User-facing usage

- Enable subagents in settings when exposed in the webview.
- Ask LUMI to delegate research or verification explicitly.
- Monitor subagent messages in the chat timeline like any other tool call.

## Safety

The parent launch is the approval boundary:

- **PreToolUse / PostToolUse hooks** apply per tool invocation.
- Read-only lanes use read auto-approval and receive a read/diagnostic tool subset; declared mutation lanes use edit auto-approval and otherwise request approval once.
- Inner tools do not prompt repeatedly after launch, but allowlists, mutation locks, budgets, and merge checks still apply.
- **Tool execution** in every lane enters the same [central execution funnel](parent-thread-execution-authority.md); the lane supplies its authority mode and resource-collision evidence. Full task-completion enforcement remains on parent `attempt_completion`.
- **Task lifecycle** in every lane enters the same [task lifecycle authority](task-lifecycle-authority.md). Attached child registration names the exact parent generation; parent cancellation/failure/timeout propagation is typed and auditable. Detached children do not inherit parent termination.
- **I/O authority** on non-mutating lanes: read/list/search tools bypass UniversalGuard and may parallelize when the parent pool allows — see [Governed execution runbook § Fast I/O](governed-execution-runbook.md#retry-decision-flow).
- **Production mutation authority** is SQLite-only. Memory, file locks, and Broccoli fences are projections; database outages retry or fail closed and never switch the process to local authority.
- **Lease identity** is owner + epoch + fencing token + authority mode. Tokens remain decimal strings for precision safety.

## Governed swarms

Multi-lane swarms run through `GovernedSwarmCoordinator` with durable receipts and a merge gate (optimistic reconciliation before commit). Each lane declares an **execution mode** that controls whether it acquires a governed mutation lock:

| Mode | Lock by default |
|------|-----------------|
| `read_only`, `audit_only`, `planning_only`, `documentation_only`, `diagnostic_only` | Skipped |
| `mutation` (default when omitted) | Required |

### Master of Design (MoD) Swarm Propagation
When running in MoD mode (`modEnabled: true`), parent tasks automatically propagate `modEnabled: true` down to subagents via `SubagentRunner.ts`. The subagent swarm inherits senior designer instincts (design token sensing, 7-state UI matrix, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility, visual aesthetics, responsive layout ergonomics, 5-Whys analysis) while maintaining strict execution boundaries. For detailed architecture, see [MoD Architecture](mixture-of-designers.md).

### Lifecycle (production handler)

```
roadmap pressure admit → SQLite orchestration lease → audit preflight
  → classify lane intent → acquire agent roadmap projections → DAG schedule → execute lanes
  → snapshot wait-for graph → SCC/escape analysis → version re-check
  → local events + patch proposals → per-lane completion_gate → merge gate
  → patch reconciliation → coordinator workspace commit → seal or crash seal
  → optional roadmap completion (policy-gated)
```

| Prompt / param tag | Purpose |
|--------------------|---------|
| `[execution_mode:read_only]` | Skip mutation lock |
| `[depends_on:0]` / `depends_on_2` | Lane waits until dependency sealed |
| `[roadmap_item:NOW-42]` | Link lane to roadmap item + projection |
| `[local_roadmap:progress_note:ITEM:…]` | Private agent-roadmap event (no workspace write) |
| `[propose_patch:attach_evidence:ITEM:evidence=…\|rationale=…]` | Propose workspace kanban change |
| `roadmap_completion_update=enabled` | Legacy completion policy on sealed success |

### Patch types (workspace proposals)

| Type | Use | Evidence required |
|------|-----|-------------------|
| `attach_evidence` | Link test/artifact to item | Recommended |
| `mark_complete` | Close item on kanban | **Yes** |
| `add_blocked_reason` | Record blocker on workspace | No |
| `move_lane` | Move item between Now/Next/Later | Rationale required |
| `reopen_item` | Re-open completed item | Rationale required |
| `advisory_only` | Suggestion only — not committed | No |

See [quick reference](governed-roadmap-projection-quickref.md) for full tag syntax and rejection reasons.

**Roadmap invariant:** Agents own private `agentRoadmap` projections. Only the coordinator commits workspace roadmap changes via reconciled `proposedWorkspacePatch` under `roadmap:workspace` lock. Do not mutate workspace kanban directly from lanes.

**Boundaries:** `MergeGate` is the commit barrier, not the workspace audit system. Audit evidence lives on governed receipts under `subagent_executions/` — BroccoliDB provides fencing/replay substrate only.
