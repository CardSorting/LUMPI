# Architectural Enforcement Engine

LUMI is unique because it includes a built-in **Architectural Enforcement Engine**. This isn't just a linter; it's a real-time policy layer that monitors every thought and action the agent takes to ensure your codebase remains clean, modular, and stable.

## 🛡️ The Universal Guard

At the heart of LUMI is the **Universal Guard**. This system acts as a forensic monitor that sits between the AI's reasoning and your physical workspace.

- **Layer Awareness**: LUMI understands the specific role of every file in your project (e.g., `DOMAIN`, `CORE`, `INFRASTRUCTURE`).
- **Contextual Blocking**: In **Plan Mode**, the guard actively prevents the agent from making side effects in sensitive layers like `CORE` or `DOMAIN`, ensuring that the planning phase remains pure and focused on architecture.
- **Architectural Guidance**: If the agent proposes a change that violates project layering rules (e.g., a Domain model importing from an Infrastructure adapter), the Guard intercepts the action and provides immediate "Architectural Feedback."

## 🩺 Autonomous Self-Healing

LUMI doesn't just write code; it maintains it. The **Refactor Healer** system runs automatically after file edits to ensure consistency:

- **Tag Alignment**: Automatically synchronizes JSDoc tags, file headers, and metadata to match project standards.
- **Import Resolution**: Ensures that new code uses the correct project-wide aliases and follows module boundary rules.
- **Structural Cleanup**: If an edit introduces minor structural inconsistencies, the healer attempts to resolve them before presenting the final result for your approval.

## 📡 Reactive Policy Observation

LUMI monitors the AI's "thought stream" in real-time, even before a tool is executed:

- **Smell Detection**: The **Policy Observer** scans streaming output for "architectural smells"—patterns that indicate the agent might be heading toward a poor design choice.
- **Real-time Warnings**: It can surface warnings to both you and the AI agent during the thinking phase, allowing for immediate course correction before code is even written.

## 📊 Stability Telemetry

Every change is measured for its impact on project health:

- **Stability Scores**: After a successful edit, LUMI calculates a stability score for the affected file based on complexity, churn, and dependency health.
- **Violation Tracking**: The system tracks how many architectural violations were introduced or resolved during a task, providing a clear "Net Health" impact report.

## ⚡ Central execution funnel

Every parent, sibling, and subagent tool invocation enters `ExecutionFunnel`. The funnel owns registration, task/lane admission, plan mode, fencing, collision and roadmap checks, policy, hooks, the dispatch permit, reliability, and one terminal event. Query fast paths remain classifications inside this authority.

| Tier | Parent behavior |
|------|-----------------|
| **Hot** | Workspace queries reuse task authority while still enforcing required parameters, `.dietcodeignore`, cancellation, and lane admission |
| **Governed** | Mutations and side effects add plan mode, fencing, collisions, roadmap policy, guards, hooks, and consent |
| **Terminal** | One immutable event records success, failure, denial, cancellation, or the decisive block; task completion remains a separate `CompletionFunnel` decision |

When a tool is blocked, inspect the event's stable reason code and ordered stage trace; do not infer state from handler prose.
