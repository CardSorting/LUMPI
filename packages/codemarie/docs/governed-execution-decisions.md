# Governed Execution — Design Decisions

Architecture Decision Records (ADR-style) for the governed subagent harness. Status reflects current implementation.

Full architecture: [governed-subagent-execution.md](governed-subagent-execution.md).

## ADR-001: Locks protect mutation; receipts preserve truth

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Early anti-recursion guards blocked vague escalation prompts. The real failure mode was false-positive gate locks — read/audit lanes acquiring mutation ownership they never needed.

**Decision:**

- **Locks** gate exclusive mutation ownership only.
- **Receipts** record what happened for every lane, with or without a lock.
- Non-mutating lanes emit `lockRequired: false`, `claimId: null`, empty `lockBackends`.

**Consequences:**

- Parallel read-only lanes do not collide or orphan claims.
- Merge gate distinguishes mutation-without-lock (fail) from non-mutating-without-lock (pass).
- Operator console shows **lock skipped** — not "missing lock."

**Clarification (ADR-015):** *Receipts preserve truth* means **forensic** truth for merge/replay — not live authority to block continuation. See [governed-execution-authority.md](governed-execution-authority.md).

## ADR-002: Unified lock authority with layered backends

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Mutation ownership must survive process restarts, cross-process workers, and stale primary scenarios without split-brain writes.

**Decision:** Single `LockAuthority` interface with an immutable startup mode:

- `sqlite` is the only production authority. `SwarmMutexService` allocates the lease epoch and fencing token and persists the lease in one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction.
- `local_test` is explicit test-only authority. Database failure never changes a running process from `sqlite` to `local_test`.
- Roadmap admission runs before ownership. After SQLite commit, the runtime creates file, Broccoli, and in-process projections from the exact durable identity.
- A projection failure abandons the SQLite lease by full identity. Release deletes SQLite first by `resource + ownerId + leaseEpoch + fencingToken`, then cleans projections without reverting the committed database transition.
- Lease epochs and fencing tokens are arbitrary-precision decimal strings stored as SQLite `TEXT`.

**Consequences:**

- Familiar lease + fencing token pattern (Kleppmann).
- Reconciliation requires an available SQLite snapshot and treats files, Broccoli records, and memory as repairable projections.
- Malformed projections, clock skew, mode mismatch, and database outage fail closed.
- `mem_release` uses in-process release only (no workspace durable release).

**Alternatives considered:**

- File lock only → insufficient for in-process collision detection.
- Separate authorities per layer → split-brain risk.
- Dynamic SQLite-to-memory fallback → old owners and new owners could both believe they are authoritative.

---

## ADR-003: Lock necessity classifier (intent-scoped)

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Not every lane mutates. Forcing locks on audit/review lanes creates collisions, stale claims, and merge false positives.

**Decision:**

- Six execution modes; default `mutation` for backward compatibility.
- `classifyLockNecessity()` runs before `acquireLane()`.
- Escalation tags (`write_set`, `mutates_roadmap`, …) promote non-mutating lanes to lock-required.
- Post-execution `splitReadWriteSets()` + write-tool detection for merge enforcement.

**Consequences:**

- Harness authors opt out via `[execution_mode:read_only]` etc.
- Documentation/audit lanes stay durable without ownership pressure.
- Non-mutating lane that runs write tools without lock → merge blocked.

---

## ADR-004: Merge gate as optimistic reconciliation

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Parallel lanes improve throughput; success must not be declared until writes are reconciled.

**Decision:** `runMergeGate()` is the commit barrier after execution:

- Collision detection on **write sets** only.
- DAG dependency allows ordered overlap, and the handler prioritizes the longest ready dependency path.
- Separate audits for mutation-without-lock and non-mutating-with-writes.
- Orphaned/unreleased claims count only `lockRequired` lanes.

**Consequences:**

- Industry-familiar OCC pattern: execute optimistically, reconcile before commit.
- Read overlap never blocks merge.
- Violation strings are stable operator signals (catalog in runbook).

---

## ADR-005: Receipt schema v3 and attempt lineage

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Retries, crashes, and partial seals must not erase prior successful work.

**Decision:**

- Immutable per-attempt file: `{swarmId}.governed.{attemptId}.json`
- Append-only `history.jsonl` index
- Latest pointer `{swarmId}.governed.json` guarded — does not regress over sealed+merged prior when retry fails
- `parentAttemptId` + `attemptId` chain
- `loadAuthoritativeGovernedReceipt()` for operator truth

**Consequences:**

- Failed retry leaves authoritative state on prior sealed attempt.
- Chat status alone is unreliable.
- Supersession guard blocks unsafe overwrite.

---

## ADR-006: Replay checksum canonicalization

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Detect receipt/envelope tampering or drift after seal.

**Decision:** SHA-256 over a minimal canonical JSON subset (lane status, touched files, admission, merge result, replay artifact IDs).

**Consequences:**

- Lock-necessity fields (`executionMode`, `readSet`, `writeSet`) are **not** in the hash.
- Mismatch means canonical execution state drift — use `explainReplayMismatch()` for operator text.
- Checksum is integrity of execution outcome, not full receipt blob.

**Future:** Extend canonical form if lock fields must be integrity-protected.

---

## ADR-007: worker_cli as intentional subset

**Status:** Accepted (boundary)

**Context:** BroccoliDB process workers need cross-process exclusion without full LUMI coordinator.

**Decision:** `worker_cli.ts` uses shared file lock module only:

- Resource key: `governed-lane:{swarmId}:{laneId}` (differs from LUMI index-based key)
- Receipt schema v1 at `.broccolidb/governed/receipts/{workerId}.json`
- No merge gate, lock necessity, or fencing stack integration

**Consequences:**

- Do not assume worker_cli receipts interoperate with `GovernedSwarmReceipt` v3.
- Full harness parity is a future integration task.

---

## ADR-008: Default mutation mode for backward compatibility

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Existing swarms and prompts assume mutating lanes acquire locks.

**Decision:** Unmarked lanes resolve to `execution_mode: mutation`.

**Consequences:**

- No behavior change for edit-heavy swarms.
- Opt-in required for lock-skipped read/audit parallelism.

---

## ADR-009: Roadmap and audit coordination on governed receipts

**Status:** Accepted (integration pass)

**Context:** Governed swarms used roadmap only for pressure admission and MergeGate as implicit audit. Operators could not answer where roadmap planning, audit preflight, or per-lane audit entered the lifecycle.

**Decision:**

- Wire `scheduleAdmission` (pressure) + `acquireOrchestrationLease` (execution ownership) before lanes.
- Record `roadmapLinkage` and `auditIntegration` on `GovernedSwarmReceipt` schema v3 (additive fields).
- `MergeGate` documented as **commit barrier only**; workspace audit remains `completionGatePipeline`.
- Lane DAG deps via `[depends_on:N]`; audit preflight via `evaluateGatePreflightReadinessAsync`.

**Consequences:**

- Receipts prove coordination without new execution architecture.
- BroccoliDB remains substrate — audit evidence stays under `subagent_executions/`.

---

## ADR-010: Roadmap completion policy and crash sealing

**Status:** Accepted (closure pass)

**Context:** Orchestration lease was not acquired; roadmap kanban could not be updated safely; handler timeout used partial `sealReceipt` instead of `sealCrashReceipt`.

**Decision:**

- Default `advisory_only` roadmap completion; optional `roadmap_completion_update=enabled` only when sealed + merge + integrity pass.
- Release orchestration lease on seal/crash; record `orchestrationLease` on receipt.
- `SubagentToolHandler` invokes `sealCrashReceipt` on timeout/abort with `inferSwarmCrashPhase`.
- `shouldUpdateLatestPointer` preserves authoritative sealed success over failed crash retries.

**Consequences:**

- No blind roadmap mutation on failed/partial/replay-mismatched receipts.
- Operators get precise crash phases and lease risk in incident console.

---

## ADR-011: Per-agent roadmap projection (coordinator-owned workspace commits)

**Status:** Accepted (projection pass)

**Context:** Parallel lanes acquiring per-lane `roadmap:*` locks serialized kanban writes but still encouraged agents to treat the shared workspace roadmap as mutable local state. Collisions, stale leases, and smuggled completion signals made operator triage difficult.

**Decision:**

- Split roadmap into three planes: `agentRoadmap` (private), `swarmRoadmap` (read-only plan), `workspaceRoadmap` (authoritative).
- `acquireLane()` creates `agentRoadmap` projection; `requiresRoadmapMutationLock()` returns `false` — no per-lane workspace roadmap locks.
- Agents record `localRoadmapEvents` and `proposedWorkspacePatch` on lane receipts.
- `runRoadmapPatchReconciliation()` at seal merges compatible patches; `commitWorkspaceRoadmapPatches()` is the **only** workspace write path.
- Coordinator acquires `roadmap:workspace` lock once at seal when committing reconciled patches.
- `auditDirectWorkspaceRoadmapMutation()` flags `directWorkspaceRoadmapMutation` and containment violations.

**Consequences:**

- Private roadmap state is cheap; workspace truth is expensive.
- Parallel lanes no longer fight over kanban locks during execution.
- Merge gate still audits legacy direct-write signals via `RoadmapMergeAudit`.
- Operator console shows projection planes, accepted/rejected patches, commit status.

**Alternatives considered:**

- Shared roadmap mutation with finer locks → rejected; still exposes parallel mutation surface.
- Chat-only roadmap updates → rejected; no durable receipt truth.

---

## ADR-012: Projection hardening (quality gate, containment, rebase)

**Status:** Accepted (hardening pass)

**Context:** Projection model alone does not prevent vague patches, smuggled mutations in local events, or stale projections overwriting current workspace state.

**Decision:**

- **Patch quality gate** (`validatePatchQuality`) — every non-advisory patch requires full metadata; `mark_complete` / `reopen_item` require evidence; vague rationale rejected.
- **Local event containment** (`containLocalRoadmapEvents`) — allowlist private event types; mutation-like payloads rejected or converted to patches.
- **Projection rebase** (`attemptPatchRebase`) — safe rebase for `attach_evidence`, `add_blocked_reason`, etc.; stale conflicting types (`mark_complete`, `move_lane`) → `stale_conflict`.
- **Deeper reconciliation** — compatible evidence merges; conflicting lane moves fail; failed lanes cannot complete; completed items require `reopen_item`; advisory patches stay advisory.
- **Coordinator commit guards** (`canCoordinatorCommitWorkspaceRoadmap`) — merge passed, integrity valid, sealed, reconciliation passed, completion policy, `roadmap:workspace` lock.
- **Operator UX** — `GovernedReceiptPanel` shows rebase outcomes, rejection reasons, stale projection warnings.

**Consequences:**

- Only valid, evidence-backed, reconciled patches affect workspace roadmap.
- Reconciliation failures append to `mergeGate.violations` and block seal.
- Regression tests in `governedExecutionRoadmapProjectionHardening.test.ts` lock behavior.

**Non-goals (explicit):**

- No return to shared per-lane workspace mutation.
- No additional lock layers for projections.
- No lane-level workspace commit path.

---

## ADR-013: Bounded, work-conserving parent flow control

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** A fixed worker pool was necessary but insufficient. Progress events queued an unbounded number of artifact writes, deterministic failures consumed retry slots, timed-out attempts could overlap replacements, concurrent lanes shared a mutable model client, and index-order scheduling could delay the lane that unlocked the longest dependency chain.

**Decision:**

- Keep a three-request concurrency ceiling behind a priority-aware execution pool with a fast-I/O bulkhead (one reserved slot when non-mutating lanes wait). Dispatch ready lanes by weighted longest downstream critical path. Read-only and diagnostic lanes receive a dispatch boost aligned with I/O authority. Retry backoff releases its slot.
- Coalesce progress to the latest state and cap artifact/UI emission frequency. A parent I/O barrier stops progress writers before terminal sealing. Partial running progress is UI-only; durable artifacts are written at terminal staging/seal barriers.
- Serialize writes per swarm, replace artifacts atomically, and allow unrelated swarms to persist concurrently. Stage terminal state with an unsealed marker; only the parent post-reconciliation path may publish the resumable final artifact.
- Treat progress/UI telemetry as best-effort, bound UI waits, and start workers without waiting for it. Start child-stream registrations together without gating any lane.
- Run advisory audit preflight alongside workers, bound it to ten seconds, and join it at the seal barrier.
- Retry only transient infrastructure failures, at one parent layer, with capped full-jitter backoff and three total attempts.
- Acquire execution slots before lane claims; release governed locks during retry backoff so jitter does not hold lane ownership.
- Prefetch parent stream context and completion-gate options once per swarm; bound active lane executions to pool capacity plus one successor (retry backoff does not consume an active execution slot).
- Give every attempt a fresh runner, model client, prompt context, and timeout; abort and wait for quiescence before replacement.
- Give each attempt one lane-local task state and tool coordinator; completion gates never mutate parent or sibling state.
- Count tokens and cost across all attempts, and stop pending/running work when the aggregate parent budget is crossed.
- Record explicit launch consent for the declared subagent batch, then route every child operation through the identical `ExecutionFunnel` authority. Child read/edit settings apply to that child's pure intent; no launch decision or permit is inherited or reused by another invocation.
- Propagate failed dependencies immediately, diagnose true deadlocks with dependency states, and release the orchestration lease in a final cleanup barrier.
- Keep peer spawning and shared-ledger synthesis at the parent; workers return structured review/documentation requests unless explicitly assigned ownership.

**Consequences:**

- Bursty token progress no longer becomes an I/O backlog.
- Delayed progress cannot overwrite a sealed artifact, and readers never observe a partial JSON write.
- Permanent task failures free a worker slot immediately; retries do not amplify deterministic faults.
- A throttled lane waiting on jitter does not reduce active capacity for untouched lanes.
- Slow trace registration never gates execution; advisory preflight and unavailable progress UI have bounded waits.
- Approval remains explicit at the authority boundary without adding per-tool latency inside an authorized lane.
- Cancellation and retry are isolated per lane, without a shared-client abort blast radius.
- Parent receipts include retry spend and cannot report budget-crossing work as successful.
- Dependency-heavy swarms reduce makespan without raising the concurrency ceiling.
- Non-mutating lanes retain reserved pool capacity and may parallelize independent read/diagnostic tool calls when the parent enables parallel tool calling.

## ADR-014: Parent I/O fast path (superseded by central execution funnel)

**Status:** Superseded on 2026-07-18

**Context:** Parent main-thread throughput degraded when every read, list, or search paid full UniversalGuard pre/post execution, blocking advisory audits, per-read Spider registry rebuilds, and duplicate guard calls in validators. Subagent read lanes already had I/O bulkhead fairness (ADR-013) but parent tools did not share a single authority model.

**Historical decision:**

- Introduce a standalone I/O authority helper layer for guard bypass, hook skips, session spider reuse, and deferred post-guard work.
- **Hot path:** Parent I/O tools skip full guard; sync `onReadIoAuthority()` only; approval before PreToolUse before execute on list/search handlers.
- **Warm path:** Act-mode, plan-mode, and command-output audits run fire-and-forget; post-guard GC, roadmap journal, scratchpad validation, and drift detection run after `pushToolResult`.
- **Cold path:** `attempt_completion` retains authoritative audit gate with 5-minute cache-aside, progressive critical-only threshold for first blocks, and advisory→plan baseline fallback on infra failure.
- Eliminate duplicate `guardPreExecution` in `ToolValidator.checkArchitecturalPurity` — `ToolExecutor` owns guard once.
- Subagent lanes: sync preflight only in `subagentCompletionGates`; expensive `auditTask` deferred to parent seal barrier.

**Consequences:**

- Read-heavy parent loops no longer block on guard, Spider rebuild, or PreToolUse for I/O authority tools.
- Engineering verification remains fail-closed at completion; inner-loop audits are observability, not gates.
- Operators distinguish **instant I/O** from **authoritative completion**.

**Modern replacement:** `ExecutionFunnel.ts` now owns these classifications alongside registration, plan mode, fencing, collisions, roadmap policy, hooks, permit issuance, handler dispatch, reliability, and terminal events. The standalone helper and handler-local gates were removed; see the [central execution funnel](parent-thread-execution-authority.md).

**Non-goals (explicit):**

- No bypass of plan-mode write restrictions or disk blockade.
- No removal of `attempt_completion` audit gate.
- No parent parallel-tool I/O bulkhead on main thread (future work).

**Failure documentation:** Stable block reasons and ordered stage traces — [central execution funnel § Failure diagnosis](parent-thread-execution-authority.md#failure-diagnosis).

## ADR-015: Coordinator owns live authority; receipts are forensic

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Governed swarms produce many observational artifacts — lane receipts, gate envelopes, audit metadata, retry markers, reconciliation traces. Agents and operators sometimes treat these as **live execution authority**, causing receipt-driven paralysis, duplicate audit recursion, and escalation loops without workspace progress. ADR-001 established receipts as durable history but did not explicitly separate forensic truth from canonical **continuation** decisions.

**Decision:**

- **Forensic truth:** Receipts, history JSONL, gate snapshots, and audit entries record what happened — merge, replay, operator console, post-mortems.
- **Live authority:** Only the coordinator/runtime layer (`GovernedSwarmCoordinator`, parent `attempt_completion` cold path, `MergeGate` seal) decides whether execution may continue, merge, finalize, or invalidate **now**.
- Subagents may observe, recommend, annotate, and challenge — not freeze siblings or the parent using receipts alone.
- Before blocking on a receipt-shaped signal, re-evaluate current coordinator state; prefer repair/reconciliation/continuation over recursive escalation.
- Avoid duplicate audit gates and re-verification of identical invariants across layers (aligns with ADR-014 shift-right).

**Consequences:**

- Operators use authoritative state procedure — not chat status alone — when receipts disagree.
- Lane `auditDeferredToSeal` is expected observability, not lane failure.
- Runtime heuristic: repeated validation without state change indicates governance recursion — collapse gates and restore momentum.

**Non-goals:**

- Receipts do not become optional — they remain required for merge and seal.
- This does not remove intentional cold-path blockers (`attempt_completion` audit, circuit breaker, merge violations).

Full prompt and operator checklist: [governed-execution-authority.md](governed-execution-authority.md).

## ADR-016: Required merge checks, advisory audits, and bounded remediation

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** The merge gate previously flattened transaction-safety failures and evidence-quality heuristics into one `violations[]` list. Missing evidence, placeholder text, transcript pointers, and tool steps could fail an otherwise safe completed swarm. Stale ownership events were also counted historically, so `stale_detected` remained fatal after a matching release. Parent agents interpreted every failed seal as a reason to rerun the whole swarm, amplifying cost and retry loops.

**Decision:**

- Mirror familiar required-check vs informational-check workflows: only mutation safety, live ownership, terminal lane consistency, replay integrity, and authoritative roadmap conflicts block seal.
- Preserve evidence and observability quality checks as receipt/UI advisories.
- Apply the same split to envelope persistence and resume validation: missing pointers are advisory, while malformed structure, checksum mismatch, and transcript corruption remain hard.
- Emit structured `findings[]` instead of forcing callers to parse prose.
- Emit `retryDisposition`: `not_needed`, `targeted_repair`, `retry_after_recovery`, or `do_not_retry`.
- Reconstruct current claim state from lifecycle events. A matching `released` event clears prior stale/orphan state; unresolved ownership remains fail-closed.
- Keep lane-level transient retries bounded at three attempts with full jitter. Merge remediation never implies a blind whole-swarm retry.

**Consequences:**

- Safe work seals despite incomplete secondary audit metadata.
- Hard correctness and concurrency invariants remain fail-closed.
- Recovery has explicit scope, so successful lanes and billable work are preserved.
- Historical schema-v3 receipts remain readable because new fields are optional on read.

**Industry pattern mapping:**

- Required vs non-required status checks for merge policy.
- Workflow retry policies with maximum attempts and non-retryable failure classes.
- Saga-style compensation/recovery before retrying ownership failures.
- Structured reason codes instead of control flow based on log strings.

---

## ADR-017: Database-backed authority and projection-only reconciliation

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Layered locks were previously described as peers and stale files could be deleted using age/PID heuristics. That permits authority ambiguity during database outages, owner replacement, malformed projection records, and tokens beyond JavaScript's safe integer range.

**Decision:**

- SQLite is the sole production lease authority; local authority exists only in explicit `local_test` mode.
- Allocate generations and persist leases atomically under `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`.
- Store epochs and fencing tokens as decimal `TEXT`; compare with strings or `bigint` only.
- Treat memory, file locks, and Broccoli fences as exact-identity projections.
- Reconcile only from a database-available snapshot. Never reclaim on database absence.
- Isolate ownership overrides in `AdministrativeLockCleaner`, requiring a reason and per-record logging.

**Consequences:** Production fails closed during database outages, old owners cannot release new leases, projection cleanup failures cannot roll back an authoritative release, and manual cleanup is auditable rather than part of normal orchestration.

---

## ADR-018: Snapshot-consistent typed wait-for graph

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** A cycle in dependency metadata is not necessarily a deadlock. Timers, expiring leases, outside owners, and unrelated capacity holders can resolve blocked edges. Acting on a scheduler snapshot after lanes change can also recover the wrong work.

**Decision:** Build a typed `WaitEdge` graph from one immutable scheduler/lane snapshot. Run Tarjan SCC over hard dependency and ownership edges, classify timer/capacity edges as escape evidence, and declare deadlock only when an SCC has no valid escape transition. Re-check both scheduler and lane state versions immediately before recovery.

**Consequences:** Backoff and ordinary contention are not mislabeled as deadlock, self-loops and true ownership cycles are detected, and recovery actions cannot be applied from a stale diagnosis.

---

## ADR-019: Durable completion terminalization

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** In-memory completion suppression cannot survive a host restart and cannot arbitrate simultaneous terminal attempts from multiple processes. A decision also needs a stable identity independent of JSON property order.

**Decision:**

- Derive `decisionId` from canonical, recursively sorted JSON containing task ID, evaluated state version, checkpoint, outcome, and decision schema version; hash with SHA-256.
- Persist one terminal row per task in `task_completions`.
- Commit under `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` only after verifying owner, lease epoch, fencing token, protocol, expiry, freshest allocated generation, and unchanged task state version.
- Return identical decisions idempotently, suppress same-outcome duplicates, reject terminal outcome conflicts, and fail closed when one decision ID maps to a different payload.

**Consequences:** Completion survives restart, multi-connection races have one winner, stale owners cannot terminalize, and collision/corruption signals remain distinguishable from harmless duplicate delivery.
